By segment, North America\\nrevenue increased 10% Y oY from $353B to $387B, International revenue grew 9% Y oY from $131B to $143B,\\nand AWS revenue increased 19% Y oY , from $91B to $108B. For perspective, just 10 years ago, AWS\\nrevenue was $4.6B; and in that same year, Amazon’s total revenue was $89B.\\nAmazon’s operating income in 2024 improved 86% Y oY , from $36.9B (an operating margin of 6.4%) to\\n$68.6B (an operating margin of 10.8%). Free Cash Flow, adjusted for equipment finance leases improved\\nfrom $35.5B in 2023 to $36.2B.\\nApart from the financial results, we made our customers’ lives meaningfully better and easier. In our Stores\\nbusiness, we substantially expanded selection, continued lowering prices (independent research firm,\\nProfitero, found Amazon the lowest-priced online U.S. Retailer for the eighth year in a row), and for the\\nsecond year in a row, we shipped at record speed to our Prime members. AWS launched a slew of new\\ninfrastructure and AI services that make it even easier to build remarkable customer experiences, including\\nour latest custom AI silicon (Trainium2), a new set of frontier foundation models in Amazon Nova, and\\nsignificant expansion of available models and features in our leading Generative AI (“GenAI”) services\\nAmazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. Prime Video continued to offer compelling original shows,\\nincluding new seasons forFallout, Reacher, The Boys,and The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power, movies like\\nRoad House, The Idea of You,and Red One, live sports likeThursday Night Footballand UEFA Champions\\nLeague in Europe (with the NBA and NASCAR coming in 2025), and new selection, highlighted by Apple\\nTV+ joining Prime Video Channels. We launched a series of new Kindle devices that included a new color\\nversion, a larger Scribe option, and our fastest Paperwhites ever (the collection of which drove the highest\\nKindle unit sales for a single quarter in over a decade). And, we continued to add more selection, price\\ntransparency, and same day shipping for Amazon Pharmacy.\\nThese accomplishments are a subset of what the team launched in 2024, but represent a lot of invention,\\nhard work, and thoughtful execution across Amazon. I’m thankful for my teammates and their delivery this\\npast year (some of which you can see in our 2024 results, others of which won’t be visible for the next\\nfew years).\\nA Why Culture\\nEvery year in my annual letter, I try to share insight into what makes Amazon tick. At the highest level,\\nwe’re aiming to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, making customers’ lives better and easier every\\nday. This is not easy to do in general, let alone year after year. In fact, it’s actually quite hard, especially with\\nthe rapid rate of change in technology, customer habits, and new products from large and small companies\\nalike. If we want to have a chance at succeeding in our mission, we have to constantly question everything\\naround us.\\nWe’ve had this long-held philosophy at Amazon about two-way and one-way door decisions. A two-way\\ndoor decision is one where if you get the decision wrong, you can walk back through that door, revert to where\\nyou were, and there are few (if any) ramifications. Y ou can make these decisions quickly and locally. A one-\\nway door decision is one where it’s quite difficult (if not impossible) to walk back through that door if\\nyou get the decision wrong, so these decisions are made more methodically. But, both of these constructs\\nassume the door is unlocked. A lot of invention is about trying to open doors that have historically seemed\\nbolted shut. And, over the past 30 years, we’ve found one of the most important keys to unlock these doors\\nhas been a simple question: “Why?”'),\n",

He’s\\nalso reminded me how shortly after I joined Amazon in 1997, he tried to persuade me to work somewhere\\nmore traditional (and on the east coast closer to family)—only to realize that I’d already found the perfect fit.\\nThat’s because Amazon is a Why company. We ask why, and why not, constantly. It helps us deconstruct\\nproblems, get to root causes, understand blockers, and unlock doors that might have previously seemed\\nimpenetrable. Amazon has an unusually high quotient of this WhyQ (let’s call it “YQ”), and it frames the way\\nwe think about everything that we do.\\nStarting in 1995, we asked why can’t we offer customers every in-print book?\\nThen, we asked, why limit ourselves to in-print—why can’t we also offer every out-of-print book?\\nWhy not offer every book, ever written, in any language—all available within 60 seconds on a device that’s\\nlight and fits in the palm of your hand (Kindle)?\\nWhen we offer reviews, why must they all come from professional “experts?” Customers are great resources\\nand will be brutally honest. Why not include customer reviews even if they sometimes dissuade a purchase?\\nWhy not offer more than Books? What about Music, Video, Electronics, Tools, Kitchen, Apparel, Home\\nFurnishings?\\nWhy not practically everything?\\nWhy should we be the only sellers of these items? Millions of third-party merchants and small sellers offer\\nsimilar or unique items. Why not let customers choose the selection, price, and delivery speed they prefer from\\namong these millions of sellers?\\nAfter struggling for a couple years to create awareness for sellers’ selection, we asked ourselves why not\\nshow their selection on the same product detail pages as our first-party selection (where all the traffic was)?\\nWhy not allow our sellers to also store items in our fulfillment network, enable those items to have fast, Prime\\ndelivery, and fulfill those items for sellers (a program called Fulfillment by Amazon)?\\nWhy not experiment with relevant advertisements in our store to expose customers to new sellers and items\\n(versus only what our algorithms might surface based on past purchases)?\\nWhy does every company need their own capital-intensive datacenters and infrastructure? Why should every\\ndevelopment team keep reinventing services like compute, storage, database, and analytics? Why should\\nbuilders spend 80% of their time on the undifferentiated heavy lifting vs. their unique customer experience?\\nWhy not build a set of services (AWS) to solve that for internal and external builders?\\nWhy do I have to buy a physical video to watch a movie? Why do I need cable or linear TV to watch\\namazing TV shows (Prime Video)?\\nWhy can’t I get my Prime shipping benefits on other websites than just Amazon (Buy with Prime)?\\nI can go on. But, you get the idea. Every one of these Whys have led to significant invention, and every one\\nof them have made customers’ lives better and easier. Some of these seem obvious now. But at the time,\\nthese were provocative questions that required curiosity, risk-taking, experimentation, and persistence to\\nmake these into success stories.\\nEnabling a Why Culture\\nIf you believe having high YQ is critical to inventing for customers, how do you enable it? In my opinion,\\nit’s not solved with one mechanism. It needs to be built deeply into your culture and leadership team, and has\\nto be fiercely protected over time if you’re lucky enough to be successful.

They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and\\nwork to disconfirm their beliefs.”\\nWhen we first instituted this leadership principle, some people incorrectly assumed it meant that the best\\nleaders were the ones whose ideas were chosen (i.e. they were right, a lot). It led to some people overly digging\\nin and fighting for their ideas. There’s nothing wrong with pushing for what you believe. But, in my\\nexperience, the best leaders want to hear others’ views. They don’t wilt or bristle when challenged; they’re\\nintrigued. Effective leaders change their minds when presented with new compelling information (which\\nmakes it ironic how people dismiss politicians as “flip-floppers” when they change their position). Ultimately,\\nleaders are responsible for getting to the best answer for customers, regardless of whose original idea is\\nchosen.\\nLearn and be Curious\\n“Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new\\npossibilities and act to explore them.”\\nIn the nearly 28 years I’ve been at Amazon, the biggest difference in the relative growth of companies and\\nindividuals has been their aptitude to learn. At a certain point, some leaders seem to lose their thirst to learn.\\nIt’s hard to know the reason in each case, but it’s as if some people find it too exhausting, too time-\\nconsuming, or too threatening to not have all the answers. Regardless, the day we stop learning at Amazon\\nis the day we risk undermining what we’re capable of building in the future. People with high YQ are always\\ncurious how they can get better, become wiser, and incorporate their new knowledge into better customer\\nexperiences.\\nHave Backbone; Disagree and Commit\\n“Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is\\nuncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the\\nsake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.”\\nWe don’t just empower people to challenge one another, we obligate them to do so if they disagree.\\nQuestioning, asking the hard questions, forcing the discussion (versus silently thinking a mistake is being\\nmade) is necessary to getting to better answers for customers. “I told you so” has no currency at Amazon. It’s\\nalso important to focus on the second part of this leadership principle:disagree and commit. While\\nconstructive debate is useful; at some point, teams need to make a decision and take action. From that point\\non, everybody—even those who advocated for a different solution than the one chosen—must commit to\\nmaking that decision a success. That means the team goes all in—no pocket-vetoing nor hedging between\\nother options. That’s the only way we can preserve speed and confidence that if an issue is heavily debated, the\\nteam will ultimately pull together.\\nCreate norms that support the Why.Similar to how our Leadership Principles guide our behavior, we’ve built\\nnorms over the years that guide how we work. Here are a few examples:\\nNarratives. We stopped presenting information to each other inside the company via powerpoint in 2004.\\nGiven how high level powerpoints are, we found that powerpoint was easy for the presenter to prepare, but\\nharder for the audience to understand the substantive issues. Instead, we moved to writing narratives with a\\nmaximum of six pages in the body. Narratives are harder for the presenter (it’s hard to write a thoughtful six-\\npage document that highlights the key issues in enough detail to be crisp and clear), but much easier for the\\naudience to engage with and ask the right Why questions.\\nWorking backwards documents. When we build services or features, before we start coding, we write Press\\nRelease and Frequently Asked Questions (“FAQ”) documents. The Press Release is intended to ensure that\\nwhat we’re proposing building is remarkable to customers (so we don’t get to launch and ask “wait, why\\ndid we think customers would find this interesting?”).

The Press Release and FAQ are how we work backwards from customers, and\\nhow we push ourselves to ask questions customers would if they were in these meetings.\\nBe together whenever possible. There are many paths that can lead to breakthrough innovation. Occasionally,\\na lone genius comes up with a brilliant idea, and everyone else simply executes it. While that can work, it’s\\nnot how we typically operate. Amazon invention is deeply collaborative. It starts with a seed of an idea, then\\na group of smart, mission-driven people refine, challenge, and build on it together. And, we’ve found that\\nthis process is far more effective in person than remote. Of course, you can invent with everybody remote (and\\nsome cultures seem to prefer that). However, in my experience, it doesn’t compare to being in the same\\nroom. The energy, the pace, the spontaneous brainstorming, the willingness for people to jump in, the way\\nideas evolve in real time, and the post-meeting iteration is much better when in the same room—and yields\\nbetter outcomes for our customers and teams. With what’s happening in AI right now, and the likelihood\\nthat every customer experience we’ve ever known will be reinvented, there has never been a more important\\ntime, in my opinion, to optimize to invent well.\\nTolerating messy meetings. It’s hard to “schedule” innovation. Y ou can’t book 60 minutes to invent Amazon\\nPrime, or AWS, or Alexa+, or Fulfillment by Amazon, or Regionalization in our Fulfillment Network, or\\nProject Kuiper. These inventions are borne out of somebody asking why we can’t change what’s possible for\\ncustomers, and then they take on a life of their own, often meandering down multiple dead ends before\\ngetting to a final destination. This might bother some regimented folks. But, when we’re inventing, we accept\\nthe process being beautifully imperfect.\\nOperate like a startup (in our case, the world’s largest startup).We strive to operate like the world’s largest\\nstartup. What does that mean?\\nFirst, whatever we’re contemplating building has to be focused on solving a real customer problem or\\nmeaningfully improving a customer experience. Companies can get off track prioritizing technology because\\nthey’re excited about the technology. Great startups are on a mission to change what’s possible for customers.\\nSecond, we have a disproportionate need for builders. These are inventors. They’re people constantly\\ndissecting customer experiences, even ones that seem pretty good today, and asking why they can’t be better.\\nThey’re divinely discontent (maybe annoyingly so for team members proud of what they’ve previously\\nbuilt), and never feel like the job is done.\\nThird, we want owners. One of the strengths of Amazon over the first 30 years is that we’ve hired really\\nsmart, motivated, inventive, ambitious people who have been great owners. And, that means that our\\nteammates are constantly asking themselves, “What would I do if this was my own money?” “What would I\\ndo if I started this company and I was the majority owner?” “Hey, I know I’ve only been asked to own a\\npart of this project, but I’m not sure if the other parts are being driven well—should I stick my nose into this\\nand make sure or just trust somebody’s got it?” Owners feel accountable. They care deeply about the\\nquality and effectiveness of what they own, and view the company’s mission as their mission (we want\\nmissionaries, not mercenaries). That’s part of what our effort to increase the ratio of individual contributors\\nversus managers is about. We want flatter organizations where our owners doing the work feel like they\\nown the two-way door decisions (which are the vast majority), can move rapidly, and are fully accountable\\nfor solving the Whys of their customer experiences.\\nFourth, speed disproportionately matters for every business, in every industry, at all times. It’s a false binary\\nto argue that you can move fast or deliver high standards. If you want to be fast, you can be fast, and still\\nbe high quality. We’ve done it for many years (though we can still be faster). Speed is a leadership decision.\\nThe leadership team has to believe it’s a priority, reinforce it constantly, organize and remove structural\\nbarriers, and build in modular ways that enable pace. But, speed does not happen unless the entire company\\nand culture embrace it. We have this persistent feeling, throughout the company and in every business in\\nwhich we operate, that there are closing windows all around us. We operate in fiercely competitive market\\nsegments, with highly talented, well-funded, ambitious companies at every turn. Customers are always looking'),\n",

There is a difference between process and bureaucracy.\\nWhen you’re running something at scale, you need mechanisms to deliver the right experience and constant\\nimprovement for customers. However, as companies grow and add more managers, unneeded processes get\\nlayered on that add little value. Last fall, I asked teammates across the company to send me bureaucracy\\nexamples that they were experiencing. I’ve received almost 1,000 of these emails, and read every single one.\\nBuilders hate bureaucracy. It slows them down, frustrates them, and keeps them from doing what they came\\nhere to do. As leaders, we don’t always see the red tape buried deep in our organizations, but we can sure\\nas heck eliminate it when we do. We’ve already made over 375 changes based on this feedback. We need to\\nmove fast, and we are committed to rooting out bureaucracy that ties up time and dispirits our teammates.\\nFifth, you have to be scrappy. As businesses succeed and get larger, they sometimes forget how things got\\nstarted. We built Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) with 13 people; Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud\\n(EC2) with 11 people. Managers can confuse themselves that the way to grow and get ahead is to accumulate\\nlarge teams. Historically, we’ve had periods where we’ve allowed this thinking to hold sway. But, it’s not the\\nway we fundamentally think about building teams and products, and have adjusted to reflect that again. Our\\nbest leaders get the most done with the least number of resources required to do the job. They pride\\nthemselves on being lean.\\nSixth, you have to be willing to take risks. This sounds easier than it is. Y ou need clever enough people to\\nidentify worthwhile bets. And if you have these inventive, ambitious builders with high standards, they’re not\\nused to failure. They suspect external (and maybe internal) ridicule awaits them if they try something very\\ndifferent that doesn’t work out. So, people often play it safe. But, you can’t achieve something extraordinary\\nfor customers by playing “not to lose.” If your Whys take you down an invention path that delivers an\\nexperience that doesn’t look like what’s been done before, let customer obsession be your compass. Y ou rarely,\\nif ever, change the world by doing the same thing as everybody else.\\nAnd finally, you have to care most about delivering compelling results for customers. It’s not how charismatic\\nyou are. It’s not whether you’re really good at managing up or sideways. What matters is what we actually\\nget done for customers. That’s what we want to reward.\\nNext generation Whys\\nWhile the team and I feel quite optimistic about the progress and potential of our existing businesses, we\\nhave plenty of new Whys we’re asking. Below are a few of them and some quick thoughts.\\nWhy is AI so important? Will it really have as much impact as some claim and when?\\nGenerative AI is going to reinvent virtually every customer experience we know, and enable altogether new\\nones about which we’ve only fantasized. The early AI workloads being deployed focus on productivity and\\ncost avoidance (e.g. customer service, business process orchestration, workflow, translation, etc.). This is\\nsaving companies a lot of money. Increasingly, you’ll see AI change the norms in coding, search, shopping,\\npersonal assistants, primary care, cancer and drug research, biology, robotics, space, financial services,\\nneighborhood networks—everything. Some of these areas are already seeing rapid progress; others are still\\nin their infancy. But, if your customer experiences aren’t planning to leverage these intelligent models, their\\nability to query giant corpuses of data and quickly find your needle in the haystack, their ability to keep\\ngetting smarter with more feedback and data, and their future agentic capabilities, you will not be competitive.\\nHow soon? It won’t all happen in a year or two, but, it won’t take ten either. It’s moving faster than almost\\nanything technology has ever seen.'),\n",

That’s why\\nthere are more than 1,000 GenAI applications being built across Amazon, aiming to meaningfully change\\ncustomer experiences in shopping, coding, personal assistants, streaming video and music, advertising,\\nhealthcare, reading, and home devices, to name a few. It’s also why AWS is quickly developing the key\\nprimitives (or building blocks) for AI development, such as custom silicon AI chips in Amazon Trainium to\\nprovide better price-performance on training and inference, highly flexible model-building and inference\\nservices in Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock, our own frontier models in Amazon Nova to provide\\nlower cost and latency for customers’ applications, and agent creation and management capabilities.\\nThere is also substantial capital investment required. In AWS, the faster demand grows, the more datacenters,\\nchips, and hardware we need to procure (and AI chips are much more expensive than CPU chips). We\\nspend this capital upfront, even though these assets are useful for many years (in the case of datacenters, for\\nat least 15-20 years). We only start monetizing this capital investment many months after we spend the\\ncapital, and over many years—which leads to attractive long-term FCF and ROIC (as people have seen in\\nAWS over the last several years). But in periods, like now, of unusually high demand (our AI revenue is\\ngrowing at triple digit Y oY percentages and represents a multi-billion-dollar annual revenue run rate), you’re\\ndeploying a lot of capital. We continue to believe AI is a once-in-a-lifetime reinvention of everything we\\nknow, the demand is unlike anything we’ve seen before, and our customers, shareholders, and business will\\nbe well-served by our investing aggressively now.\\nWhy do chips and AI have to be this expensive for customers?\\nAI does not have to be as expensive as it is today, and it won’t be in the future. Chips are the biggest culprit.\\nMost AI to date has been built on one chip provider. It’s pricey. Trainium should help, as our new Trainium2\\nchips offer 30-40% better price-performance than the current GPU-powered compute instances generally\\navailable today. While model training still accounts for a large amount of the total AI spend, inference\\n(which are the predictions or outputs of the models) will represent the overwhelming majority of future AI\\ncost because customers train their models periodically, but produce inferences constantly in large-scale AI\\napplications. Inference will become another building block service, along with compute, storage, database,\\nand others. We feel strong urgency to make inference less expensive for customers. More price-performant\\nchips will help. But, inference will also get meaningfully more efficient in the next couple of years with\\nimprovements in model distillation, prompt caching, computing infrastructure, and model architectures.\\nReducing the cost per unit in AI will unleash AI being used as expansively as customers desire, and also lead\\nto more overall AI spending. It’s like what happened with AWS. Revolutionizing the cost of compute and\\nstorage happily led to lower cost per unit, and more invention, better customer experiences, and more absolute\\ninfrastructure spend.\\nWhy have personal assistants not yet taken off? How can Alexa help?\\nA great personal assistant can answer virtually any question and get things done on your behalf. There have\\nbeen no digital solutions that can do both yet. That is, until Alexa+ arrived. Alexa+ is not only comparably\\nintelligent to the leading chatbots, but can take a plethora of real actions for you. She can play music, play\\nvideo, move media from one of your devices to another, set alarms and timers, control your smart home,\\norder across hundreds of millions of ecommerce items, make reservations for restaurants or Ubers, order\\nconcert tickets, alert you when your favorite artist announces a tour, find a plumber to fix your sink, and\\nmemorize whatever you’ve done on Amazon. This is pretty game-changing for consumers, and just the start of\\nwhat Alexa+ will do. We have over 600 million Alexa devices out there today, and expect Alexa+ to play\\nan even more vital role in the lives of these hundreds of millions of customers in the future.\\nWhy can’t we get items to customers even faster? Does it matter?\\nEvery year, people ask whether we’ve reached the law of diminishing returns on speed of delivery. Our data\\nshows this not to be the case. When we promise faster delivery times, customers complete purchases at a\\nmeaningfully higher rate and shop with us more frequently. Amazon Prime started with unlimited, free, two-\\nday delivery for a million products; it’s now grown to over 300 million items, with tens of millions available'),\n",

An increasing number of deliveries happen same day. This speed improvement is\\nprimarily due to our regionalization redesign of our fulfillment network, our new placement algorithms, and\\nthe introduction of our innovative same-day fulfillment centers. Although we’ve set speed records for two\\nconsecutive years, we’re still honing these innovations, and have others planned. And, don’t forget Prime Air,\\nour drones that will get items to customers inside an hour. We are not done improving speed.\\nWhy can’t people in small towns enjoy the same fast delivery speeds as people in cities?\\nAs some other companies are abandoning small-town customers due to cost to serve, we’re going the other\\nway—we’re investing to serve our rural customers even better. We’ve already expanded Same-Day and\\nOvernight Delivery to dozens of smaller cities and towns across the U.S., with more coming. This expansion\\nwill provide even faster Amazon delivery speeds for many millions of customers, particularly in less\\ndensely populated areas, enabling us to deliver over a billion packages each year to customers living in\\n13,000 zip codes spanning 1.2 million square miles.\\nRelated, why can’t we help the hundreds of millions of people without broadband connectivity?\\nThere are about 400-500 million households around the world, most in small, rural towns that don’t have\\naccess to broadband connectivity. They can’t leverage the Internet to learn, shop, do business, access\\nentertainment, and communicate the same way people take for granted in bigger cities. This digital divide is\\nwhat Project Kuiper, our low Earth orbit satellite network, aims to solve. We’re just launching our first\\nproduction satellites, and will ultimately have over 3,200 in orbit over the next few years. While capital-\\nintensive to launch, we believe Kuiper will be a meaningful operating income and ROIC business for us.\\nWhy does healthcare have to be so stressful?\\nHealthcare, especially in the U.S., is quite frustrating. It’s hard to get fast appointments with primary care\\nphysicians, often harder with specialists. There’s a lot of waiting around. Physicians spend only a few minutes\\nwith patients. Then, patients have to drive somewhere (often not close) to get their medications. And, when\\nthey get to the pharmacy, they’re often surprised by the pricing, what’s covered by their insurance, and what\\nyou can easily access that’s not behind a locked shelf. Customers deserve better. It’s why you see such\\npositive customer sentiment and growth for Amazon Pharmacy and Amazon One Medical, and we continue\\nto iterate quickly on selection and transparency for Amazon Pharmacy, and physical clinic capacity for\\nOne Medical.\\nThese are some of the Why questions we’re asking ourselves right now, and I’m excited about the future\\ninventions to come. We’re not going to be bored any time soon.\\nWhen I first started working, I thought it was unfathomable that my Dad worked at the same place for\\n45 years. How could that be? That’s so long. I used to tell my friends that would never be me. Now, with almost\\n28 years and counting at Amazon, I have to answer those same friends with their own Why question.\\nAfter all these years, why are you still at Amazon?\\nI’m obviously a Superfan, but there are several compelling parts to working at Amazon. First, I’m not sure\\nthat any company prioritizes customers as relentlessly as we do. Lots of companies say they will; few follow\\nthrough. Second, it’s challenging to find a company where you can make a bigger impact on the world\\nthan you can at Amazon. Third, we make significant long-term investments and bets in both inventions and\\npeople. This allows our teams to iterate on ideas, and make the right long-term decisions for customers\\nand the company. And, I’ve never encountered a more intelligent, creative, ambitious, hungry, hard-working,\\nand missionary group of teammates than we have at Amazon. In my opinion, this is a remarkable set of\\nqualities to have at a company. And, for builders who want to change the world, and who have fire in their\\nbelly, there’s no better place to be than Amazon.'),\n",

The competitive\\nlandscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings\\nand have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales.

We have invested and will continue to invest\\naggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an\\nenduring franchise.\\nBecause of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than\\nsome companies.

We realized that the\\nWeb was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply\\ncould not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than\\nwas possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-\\nto-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged\\nfocus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer\\ncustomers gift certificates, 1-Click\\nSM shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and\\nrecommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth\\nremains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers\\nhave placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader\\nin online bookselling.\\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\\n• Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.\\n• Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.\\n• The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to\\nover 58% in the same period in 1997.\\n• In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the\\ntop 20.\\n• We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America\\nOnline, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.'),\n",

Business\\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking \\nstatements based on expectations, estimates, and projections as of the date of this filing. Actual results and outcomes may differ \\nmaterially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I — “Risk Factors.” As used herein, \\n“Amazon.com,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates \\notherwise.\\nGeneral\\nWe seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than \\ncompetitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our \\nsegments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, \\nadvertisers, and employees.\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services \\n(“AWS”). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. \\nInformation on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — \\nSegment Information.”\\nConsumers\\nWe serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design \\nour stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product \\ncategories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically \\nvisiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, Ring, Blink, \\nand eero, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-\\nto-use functionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer subscription services such as Amazon Prime, a \\nmembership program that includes fast, free shipping on tens of millions of items, access to award-winning movies and series, \\nlive sports, and other benefits.\\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks \\nthat we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. \\nWe operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, \\n“Properties.”\\nSellers\\nWe offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using \\nour services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity \\nfees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.\\nDevelopers and Enterprises\\nWe serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, \\nthrough AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and \\nmachine learning, and other services. \\nContent Creators\\nWe offer programs that allow authors, independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app \\ndevelopers, and others to publish and sell content.\\nAdvertisers\\nWe provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored \\nads, display, and video advertising.\\n3'),\n",

The worldwide \\nmarketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from \\nmany different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and \\nomnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to \\nconsumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and \\nall distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, virtual \\nassistants, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in \\ncollaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, \\nomnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment \\nprocessing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or \\noffline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based \\ninfrastructure, tools and services relating to artificial intelligence, and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, \\nmarket, or sell consumer electronics, communications, and other electronic devices and services; (8) companies that sell grocery \\nproducts online and in physical stores; (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats; and \\n(10) providers of virtual or in-person healthcare services. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail \\nbusinesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for \\nour seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ \\nability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, \\nlonger histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. \\nThey may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that \\nrestrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive \\nterms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The internet facilitates competitive \\nentry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. \\nEach of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and \\nwell-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their \\ncompetitive positions.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary \\ntechnologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, \\ntrade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to \\nprotect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain \\nnames, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications \\ncovering certain of our proprietary technology. \\nSeasonality\\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, \\nwhich ends December 31. \\nHuman Capital\\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2024, we \\nemployed approximately 1,556,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and \\ntemporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software \\nengineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for \\npersonnel across other parts of our business.\\nWe strive to be Earth’s best employer. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement this objective and \\ninvent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills \\ntraining and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (education funding for eligible employees). Over 240,000 \\nAmazon employees around the world have participated in Career Choice. We also continue to inspect and refine the \\nmechanisms we use to hire, develop, evaluate, and retain our employees. In addition, safety is integral to everything we do at \\nAmazon and we continue to invest in safety improvements such as capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety \\ncontrols, and engineering ergonomic solutions. Our safety team is dedicated to using the science of safety to solve complex \\nproblems and establish new industry best practices. We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and \\nhave deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.\\n4'),\n",

Risk Factors\\nPlease carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an \\ninvestment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may \\nor may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, \\nreputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, \\nliquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by \\nfactors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant \\nrisks to our operations. In addition to the factors discussed in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of \\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in the risk factors below, global economic and geopolitical conditions and \\nadditional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below. \\nMany of the risks discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on us.\\nBusiness and Industry Risks\\nWe Face Intense Competition\\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, \\nincluding cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-\\ncommerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, \\nhealthcare, communications, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have \\ngreater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched \\nproducts and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive \\npricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\\nCompetition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and \\nwell-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in \\nother market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including \\nsearch, web and infrastructure computing services, practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, digital \\ncontent, satellites, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The internet facilitates competitive entry and \\ncomparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result \\nof competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may \\nbe required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.\\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks\\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or \\nservice offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if \\ncustomers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by, service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or \\nquality issues. In addition, profitability or other intended benefits, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, \\nand we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often \\nsignificant. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the \\n6'),\n",

In \\ncertain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-\\nmarket advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and \\npromote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.\\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of \\nrisks, including:\\n• local economic and political conditions;\\n• government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive \\ngovernmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and \\ntariffs, and restrictions around the import and export of certain products, technologies, and components); \\nnationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;\\n• restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, \\nservices, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal \\nprecedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media \\nproducts and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\\n• business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, electronic devices, and \\ncommunications services;\\n• limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\\n• limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;\\n• shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\\n• laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, \\nconsumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\\n• lower levels of use of the internet;\\n• lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;\\n• lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;\\n• difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural \\ndifferences;\\n• different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;\\n• compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting \\ncorrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;\\n• laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and\\n• geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.\\nAs international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will \\nintensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive \\nadvantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local \\nbrand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.\\nThe People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in \\ncountry through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the internet, IT \\ninfrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products \\nand services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide \\ncertain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide \\nservices. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online \\nmulti-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-\\nparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a \\nthird-party seller on the www.amazon.in marketplace.

In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to \\ncontinue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships \\nwe or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the \\ninterpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other \\nfinancial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely. \\nIn addition, because China-based sellers account for significant portions of our third-party seller services and advertising \\nrevenues, and China-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods, regulatory and trade \\nrestrictions, data protection and cybersecurity laws, economic factors, geopolitical events, security issues, or other factors \\nnegatively impacting China-based sellers and suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.\\nThe Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations\\nDemand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, \\npromotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to global economic conditions such as recessionary \\nfears or rising inflation, natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a \\nresult of climate change), or geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur \\nduring our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet \\ncustomer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be \\nrequired to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce \\nprofitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and \\nadditional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our \\nwebsites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites \\nunavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the \\nattractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and \\ncustomer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-\\nsourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network \\noptimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.\\nAs a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \\nbalances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing \\nactivities) because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores and the related receivables settle quickly. Typically, there \\nis also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases and third-party seller sales. \\nOur accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as vendors and sellers are paid, \\nresulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.\\nWe Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers\\nThe law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have \\nin the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we \\nmaintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers \\nnever receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions, \\nand to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling \\ngoods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When \\nthese policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation \\nand we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may \\nreimburse customers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of \\nthis program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. \\nWe Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing \\nIntellectual Property Rights of Third Parties\\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and \\nsimilar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret \\nprotection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary \\nrights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made \\navailable. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. \\nFurthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights.

We also \\nhold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and \\nJapanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \\nbalances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.\\nOperating Risks\\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\\nWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service \\nofferings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our \\nbusiness can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial \\nresources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage \\ngrowth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\\nWe Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\\nWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales \\nestimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending \\nquickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating \\nprofit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our \\nbusiness is affected by, among other things, general economic, business, and geopolitical conditions worldwide. A softening of \\ndemand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in \\ndecreased revenue or growth.\\nOur sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in \\nthis section and the following:\\n• our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ \\ndemands;\\n• our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;\\n• our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;\\n• the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;\\n9'),\n",

For example, we \\nrely on a limited group of suppliers for semiconductor products, including products related to artificial intelligence \\ninfrastructure such as graphics processing units.

In addition, violations by our suppliers \\nor other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain \\nStandards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our \\nreputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\\nOur Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks\\nWe provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through \\ncommercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, \\ntechnology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services \\nthrough our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other \\nresource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, \\nand develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, \\ninventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third \\nparties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially \\ndependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are not successful, the \\ncompensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to \\nenter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject \\nto claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or \\ndeveloping these services.\\nAs our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We \\nmay in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their \\ncontractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.\\nOur present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such \\nas:\\n• disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\\n• impairment of other relationships;\\n• variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and\\n• difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.\\n12'),\n",

A large number of jurisdictions regulate our \\noperations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses \\nexpand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews, investigations, and other proceedings by governments and \\nregulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our \\noperations. For example, we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations infringe \\ncompetition or consumer protection rules, including aspects of Amazon’s operation of its stores, including its fulfillment \\nnetwork and Prime, and certain aspects of AWS’s offering of cloud services. We strongly dispute these claims and intend to \\ndefend ourselves vigorously in these investigations. Similarly, we face investigations under a growing patchwork of laws and \\nregulations governing the collection, use, and disclosure of data, the interpretation of which continues to evolve, leading to \\nuncertainty about how regulators will view our privacy practices. In addition, regulators and lawmakers are increasingly \\nfocused on controlling additional aspects of the operations of technology companies and companies they have characterized to \\nbe online “gatekeepers” through the application of existing regulations and laws and the adoption of new regulations and laws, \\nwhich increases our compliance costs and limits the operation of our business. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or \\ninterpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or \\nenforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil \\nand criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our \\nproducts and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially \\nadverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations. The \\nmedia, political, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks. \\nClaims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of \\nOperations\\nAs an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we \\nare regularly subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including \\nproceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual \\nproperty matters, taxes, labor and employment (including the characterization of delivery drivers), competition and antitrust, \\nprivacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, \\ngoods and services offered by us and by third parties (including artificial intelligence technologies and services), healthcare, and \\nother matters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope \\nand geographic reach, as our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more \\npeople, and as governments and regulatory authorities seek to regulate us on a pre-emptive basis. For example, we are litigating \\na number of matters alleging price fixing, monopolization, and consumer protection claims, including those brought by state \\nattorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us \\nbecause of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. \\nThe outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves \\nor possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable \\noutcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such \\namounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a \\nmaterial effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible \\nthat a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, \\nconsent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or \\nservices, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of \\nnon-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on \\nour operations. \\nWe Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or \\nManufacture\\nSome of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal \\ninjury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions.

Although we maintain \\nliability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will \\ncontinue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that \\nare intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for \\nbreaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from \\nproduct liability.\\nWe Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations\\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign \\njurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for \\ntax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to \\ntax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. \\nSuch changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions \\nare considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, \\ntargeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect \\nsales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result \\nin liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising \\nand marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader \\ninternational tax reform is implemented. In addition, the European Union and other countries (including those in which we \\noperate) have enacted or have committed to enact global minimum taxes, which may increase our tax expense.\\nOur results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or \\nretroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to \\nprovide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government \\nagencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly \\ncomply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.\\nOur tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, \\ninvestments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, \\nlosses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or \\nextraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income \\nand loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the \\nordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is \\nuncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.\\nWe are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. \\nDevelopments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash \\nflows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Due to the \\ninherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial, \\nadministrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially \\ndifferent from our expectations. For example, the Indian tax authority has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to \\nAmazon in the U.S. We are contesting this position; however, if this matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay \\nadditional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. We regularly assess the \\nlikelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we \\nbelieve our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be \\nmaterially different from our historical tax accruals.\\nWe Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations\\nOur contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement \\nregulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and \\ninvestigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and \\nadministrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment \\nof fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business.

We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-\\nlooking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. \\nActual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign \\nexchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional \\nlabor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and \\nemerging technologies, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, \\nthe mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the \\nextent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, \\ninternational growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, \\nfulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree \\nto which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic \\ntransactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical \\nconditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. \\nThese risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ \\nsignificantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”\\nOverview\\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered \\nthrough our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, \\nand we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from \\nitems we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as \\nservice sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product \\ncategories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, \\nand digital content subscriptions.\\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by \\nincreasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital \\nexpenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily \\nresult from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by \\ninvestments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer \\nexperience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including \\nlowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original \\ncontent, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving \\nreliability, and earning customer trust. See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional \\ninformation on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.\\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product \\nand content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, \\ntransportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs \\ninclude the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online \\nstores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment network. Variable costs \\ngenerally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, \\ngeographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to \\nlower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our \\nprocesses. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.\\nWe seek to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before our payments to vendors and sellers become due. \\nBecause consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores, our receivables from consumers settle quickly.

Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital \\nspending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-\\nfunctionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and infrastructure, \\nincluding AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in infrastructure to \\nenhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the \\nspeed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical \\napplications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users’ experience on the internet and \\nincrease its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in \\nAWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine \\nlearning, and other services to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy \\ninnovative and efficient software and electronic devices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite \\nnetwork for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. \\nWe seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, \\nsuch as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock \\nunits as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests \\nof our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards \\noutstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 10.8 billion \\nand 10.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\\nOur financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our \\nreported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our \\ninternational locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained \\nconstant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our \\nconsolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our \\nincreasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders \\nover the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of \\ncurrency changes.\\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the \\neffect of movements in foreign exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either \\npositively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.\\nFor additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and \\nSupplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.”\\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a discussion and analysis of our \\nfinancial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s \\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States \\n(“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, \\nand related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical \\naccounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation \\nuncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of \\nthe Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have \\nother key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to \\nunderstanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — \\nNote 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.” Although we believe that our \\nestimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may \\ndiffer significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\\nInventories\\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and \\nare valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value.

These \\ncommitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, \\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or \\nwithout notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and \\nestimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of \\nbusiness for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to \\nchange due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use \\nour deferred tax assets. \\nOur effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, \\ninvestments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, \\nincluding earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated \\nin jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related \\ntax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to \\nour forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and \\nliabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to \\ntax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In \\naddition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate \\nmultinationals. \\nWe are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional \\nincome tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect \\non our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and \\nsubsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the \\nadequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, \\nand any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\\n  Year Ended December 31,\\n 2023 2024\\nCash provided by (used in):\\nOperating activities $ 84,946 $ 115,877 \\nInvesting activities  (49,833)  (94,342) \\nFinancing activities  (15,879)  (11,812) \\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and \\nmarketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $86.8 billion and $101.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. \\nAmounts held in foreign currencies were $23.5 billion and $25.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. Our foreign \\ncurrency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupees, and Japanese Yen. \\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $84.9 billion and $115.9 billion in 2023 and 2024. Our operating cash \\nflows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and \\nadvertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and \\nrelated transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities \\ngenerally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow in 2024, compared to the prior year, was due to an \\nincrease in net income (loss), excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific \\npoint in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the \\ntiming of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold \\nimprovements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for \\n22'),\n",

U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to \\nexpense a portion of qualified property, primarily equipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually \\nfrom 2023 through 2026. Our federal tax provision included accelerated depreciation deductions for 2022, 2023, and 2024. \\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for \\nU.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses.

These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual \\nprovisions.\\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, \\nas well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next \\ntwelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See \\nItem 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit \\nfacilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay \\ndividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial \\nposition. \\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders.

We are a public accounting firm \\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal \\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material \\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material \\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to \\nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates \\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that \\nour audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matter\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated \\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to \\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, \\nsubjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the \\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, \\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\n34'),\n",

As a result, significant judgment \\nis required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The \\nCompany uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more \\nlikely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. \\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company reported accrued liabilities of $6.5 billion for various tax \\ncontingencies.\\nAuditing the recognition and measurement of the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because \\nthe evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the \\nbenefit of various tax positions can be complex and involves significant auditor judgment. Management’s \\nevaluation of tax positions is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings, and may be impacted \\nby regulatory changes and judicial and examination activity.\\nHow We \\nAddressed the \\nMatter in Our \\nAudit\\nWe tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, \\nincluding controls over: the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained; \\nthe measurement of the benefit of its tax positions, both initially and on an ongoing basis; and the \\ndevelopment of the related disclosures. \\nWe involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in \\nassessing the technical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the \\nspecific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our \\nprocedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including the Company’s \\ncorrespondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions \\nare based. We used our knowledge of and experience with international, transfer pricing, and other income \\ntax laws of the relevant taxing jurisdictions to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax \\ncontingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential \\neffects on the Company’s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed the \\nappropriateness of the Company’s assumptions and the accuracy of the Company’s calculations and data \\nused to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize. We evaluated the Company’s income tax \\ndisclosures in relation to these matters.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996. \\nSeattle, Washington\\nFebruary 6, 2025 \\n35'),\n",

In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, \\nconsisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. We serve consumers \\nthrough our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to \\ngrow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services, and programs that allow authors, \\nindependent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell \\ncontent. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology \\nservices, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and \\nsell electronic devices. In addition, we provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through \\nprograms such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — \\nSegment Information.” \\nCommon Stock Split\\nOn May 27, 2022, we effected a 20-for-1 stock split of our common stock and proportionately increased the number of \\nauthorized shares of common stock. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”), and per share or per RSU information throughout \\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a \\npar value of $0.01 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split \\nwas reclassified from “Additional paid-in capital” to “Common stock.”\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities \\n(collectively, the “Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable \\ninterest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our \\nhealthcare services. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. \\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the \\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the \\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives \\nof equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation \\nforfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and \\noperating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video \\ncontent. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing \\nbasis. \\nIn Q4 2024, we completed a useful life study for certain types of heavy equipment and are increasing the useful life from \\nten years to thirteen years for such equipment effective January 1, 2025. Based on heavy equipment included in “Property and \\nequipment, net” as of December 31, 2024, we estimate an increase in 2025 operating income of approximately $0.9 billion, \\nwhich will be recorded primarily in “Fulfillment” and impact our North America and International segments.\\nWe completed our most recent servers and networking equipment useful life study in Q4 2024, and are changing the \\nuseful lives of a subset of our servers and networking equipment, effective January 1, 2025, from six years to five years. For \\nthose assets included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2024, whose useful life will change from six years \\nto five years, we anticipate a decrease in 2025 operating income of approximately $0.7 billion. We expect to continue to acquire \\nmore of these server and networking assets in 2025. In 2024, we also determined, primarily in the fourth quarter, to retire early \\ncertain of our servers and networking equipment. We recorded approximately $920 million of accelerated depreciation and \\nrelated charges for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 related to these decisions. The accelerated depreciation will continue \\ninto 2025 and decrease operating income by approximately $0.6 billion in 2025.

Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, \\nincluding sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is \\nallocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone \\nselling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin. \\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\\nRetail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of \\nthe goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an \\nAmazon delivery, to the customer.\\nThird-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders \\nusing our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and \\nshipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon \\ndelivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. \\nAdvertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through \\nprograms such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the \\nnumber of clicks or impressions.\\nSubscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to \\ncontent including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime \\nmemberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. \\nSubscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized \\nover the subscription period.\\nAWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is \\nallocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based \\non the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including \\ncompute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales \\ncommissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\\nOther - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as healthcare services, certain licensing and \\ndistribution of video content, and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when \\ncontent is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed.\\nReturn Allowances \\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for \\nreturn allowances are included in “Accrued expenses and other” and were $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.4 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additions to the allowance were $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion, and $5.5 billion and deductions \\nfrom the allowance were $5.2 billion, $5.1 billion, and $5.5 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Included in “Inventories” on our \\nconsolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $948 million, $992 million, and $998 million as of December 31, 2022, 2023, \\nand 2024, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances. \\nCost of Sales\\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, \\nincluding costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media \\ncontent costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers \\nare included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and \\nrelated transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated \\nstatements of operations.\\nVendor Agreements\\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, \\nincentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we \\npay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost \\nof services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We \\nevaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates \\ncan be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.\\n43'),\n",

Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us \\nin fulfillment and customer service operations.\\nTechnology and Infrastructure\\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and \\ndevelopment of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and \\ndisplay of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include \\nservers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses \\nnecessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses.

Technology and infrastructure costs are generally expensed as incurred.\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and \\nselling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS.

The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares \\ngranted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of \\nestimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. Under this method, approximately 50% of the grant date fair value is \\nrecognized as expense in the first year of grant for the majority of our stock-based compensation awards. The accelerated \\nmethod also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If an award is forfeited early in its life, \\nthe adjustment to compensation expense is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. The \\nestimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated \\nestimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates \\nare revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience. \\nAdditionally, we have stock-based compensation awards that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are \\nremeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration. \\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net\\nOther operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets and asset impairments.  \\n44'),\n",

As of December 31, 2024, we held 158 million shares of Rivian’s Class A common stock, \\nrepresenting an approximate 14% ownership interest, and an approximate 13% voting interest. We determined that we have the \\nability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the \\npurchase of electric vehicles and jointly-owned intellectual property, and one of our employees serving on Rivian’s board of \\ndirectors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in “Marketable \\nsecurities” on our consolidated balance sheets, and had a fair value of $3.7 billion and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2023 and \\nDecember 31, 2024. The investment was subject to regulatory sales restrictions resulting in a discount for lack of marketability \\nof approximately $800 million as of December 31, 2021, which expired in Q1 2022.\\nIncome Taxes\\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and \\nlosses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We \\nintend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely \\noutside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such \\namounts.  \\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and \\nliabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates \\nexpected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are \\nevaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We \\nconsider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative \\nloss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods \\navailable to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. \\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (income tax contingencies). \\nThe first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is \\nmore likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The \\nsecond step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate \\nsettlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require \\nperiodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our \\nincome tax contingencies in income tax expense.\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly \\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date.

These valuations require significant judgment.\\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in \\nactive markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of \\nsecurities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from \\nor corroborated by observable market data. \\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\\nInventories\\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and \\nare valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently \\navailable information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product \\nvendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, \\nrepresenting a write-down of inventory, was $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\\nWe provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers \\nmaintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and \\ntherefore these products are not included in our inventories.\\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to \\nprovide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead \\ntimes and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain \\nelectronic device components. We have certain non-cancellable purchase commitments arising from these agreements. These \\ncommitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. \\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Other\\nIncluded in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to \\ncustomers, vendors, and prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, customer receivables, \\nnet, were $34.1 billion and $34.3 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $8.5 billion and $11.6 billion, and other receivables, net, \\nwere $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion. Prepaid expenses and other current assets, which include amounts related to non-income \\ntaxes and satellite network launch services deposits, were $5.4 billion and $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and \\nDecember 31, 2024. We currently expense satellite network launch services deposits upon launch to “Technology and \\ninfrastructure.” \\nWe estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. \\nReceivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected \\nin accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.4 billion, $1.7 billion, and $2.0 \\nbillion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024.

Depreciation and amortization expense is \\nclassified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations. \\nLeases\\nWe categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are \\ngenerally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired \\nunder finance leases are recorded in “Property and equipment, net.” All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our \\nleases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property.\\nCertain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of \\nproperty, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are \\naccounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone \\nprices.\\nLease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a \\ndiscount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present \\nvalue of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease \\nprepayments reclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and \\namortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.\\nWhen we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase \\nthe leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the \\nclassification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes \\nin price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred. \\nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the \\nterm of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the \\nestimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. \\nThe interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method \\nover the lease term.\\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the \\ntermination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded \\nliabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\\nFinancing Obligations\\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have \\ncontrol over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the \\narrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful \\nlife or the term of the obligation. \\nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are \\nderecognized, and we classify the lease as operating. \\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event \\noccurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative \\nassessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset \\nis less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and \\nindefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, \\nwe recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash \\nflows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily \\non expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible \\nassets as of April 1, 2024, resulting in no impairments.

We \\nrecognize certain transactions with governments when there is reasonable assurance that incentives included in the agreements, \\nsuch as cash or certain tax credits, will be received and we are able to comply with any related conditions. These incentives are \\nrecorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or expenses.\\nDigital Video and Music Content\\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing \\nagreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the \\nlicense fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we \\nrecognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we \\namortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line \\nbasis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are \\nexpensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to \\n“Cost of sales” predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content. \\nThe weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.1 years. We review usage and viewing patterns \\nimpacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively. \\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each \\nmajor geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an \\nevent occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of \\nvideo, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 were $17.4 billion and $19.6 billion. \\nTotal video and music expense was $18.9 billion and $20.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2024. Total video \\nand music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, \\nand costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.\\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\\nWe generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities and AAA-\\nrated money market funds. Such investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the \\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets.  \\nMarketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses \\nincluded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair \\nvalue below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a \\nforecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through “Other income (expense), net” on our \\nconsolidated statements of operations.\\nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair \\nvalue option, are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with \\nchanges recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations.\\nNon-Marketable Investments\\nNotes that are convertible to equity classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and \\nlosses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Credit losses, if any, are recorded as an allowance \\nthrough “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Upon conversion, the amount of the notes \\nreported at fair value are reclassified generally from available-for-sale to equity investments accounted for at cost, with any \\nassociated unrealized gain or loss reclassified from “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” to “Other income \\n(expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. \\nIn Q3 2023, we invested in a $1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. In Q1 2024, we \\ninvested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. In Q4 2024, we entered into an agreement and invested $1.3 billion in a \\nthird convertible note, and will invest an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025. The notes are classified as available-for-sale and \\nare classified as Level 3 assets, and as of December 31, 2024 had an estimated fair value of approximately $13.8 billion. In \\nmaking these estimates, we utilized valuation methods based on information available, including the rights and obligations of \\nthe convertible notes, other outstanding classes of securities, observable transactions such as new securities offerings, estimates \\nof expected time to and type of liquidity events and anticipated securities offerings, and discounts for lack of marketability. \\nSubsequent to December 31, 2024, a portion of the notes were converted to nonvoting preferred stock.

Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate \\nwhether the investment is impaired.

We do not consolidate the entities in which we hold \\nthese investments because we are not the primary beneficiary. \\nLong-Lived Assets\\nLong-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever \\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that \\nwould necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a \\nsignificant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate \\nthat the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.\\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying \\namount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss \\nbased on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale \\nwhen certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for \\nsale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at \\nthe lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\\nAccrued Expenses and Other\\nIncluded in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to tax-\\nrelated liabilities, leases and asset retirement obligations, self-insurance liabilities, payroll and related expenses, current debt, \\nunredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, marketing liabilities, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.\\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $7.7 billion and $7.5 billion and our \\nliabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $5.3 billion and $5.4 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by \\na customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns.\\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities\\nAlthough we maintain certain high-deductible, third-party insurance coverage for catastrophic losses, we effectively self-\\ninsure for exposure primarily related to workers’ compensation, employee healthcare benefits, general and product liability, and \\nautomobile liability, including liability resulting from third-party transportation service providers. We estimate self-insurance \\nliabilities by considering historical claims experience, frequency and costs of claims, projected claims development, inflation, \\nand other actuarial assumptions. Changes in the number or costs of claims, healthcare costs, judgment and settlement amounts, \\nassociated legal expenses, and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. In the fourth \\nquarter of 2022, we increased our reserves for general, product, and automobile liabilities by $1.3 billion primarily driven by \\nchanges in our estimates about the costs of asserted and unasserted claims, which was primarily recorded in “Cost of sales” on \\nour consolidated statements of operations and impacted our North America segment.

The complaint alleged, among other things, that \\n“Alexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices” infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled “Natural Language Interface \\nUsing Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.” The complaint sought an injunction, an unspecified amount of \\ndamages, enhanced damages\\n, an ongoing royalty, interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. In March 2023, the plaintiffs alleged in \\ntheir damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $140 million to $267 million in \\ndamages. In March 2024, the district court granted summary judgment ruling that the patent is invalid and dismissed the case. \\nIn April 2024, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and will continue to defend \\nourselves vigorously in this matter.\\nIn December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District \\nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleged, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe \\nU.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, each entitled “Network Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol”; and \\n7,233,978, entitled “Method and Apparatus for Managing Location Information in a Network Separate from the Data to Which \\nthe Location Information Pertains.” The complaint sought an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ \\nfees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In April 2024, a jury found that Amazon infringed the asserted patents and awarded \\nKove $525 million in damages. In August 2024, the court awarded Kove $148 million in pre-judgment interest. In September \\n2024, we filed a notice of appeal. We disagree with the jury’s findings and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this \\nmatter. \\nBeginning in June 2019 with Wilcosky v. Amazon.com, Inc., now pending in the United States District Court for the \\nNorthern District of Illinois (“N.D. Ill.”), private litigants have filed a number of cases in U.S. federal and state courts, \\nincluding Hogan v. Amazon.com, Inc. (N.D. Ill.), alleging, among other things, that Amazon’s collection, storage, use, \\nretention, and protection of biometric identifiers violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The complaints allege \\npurported classes of Illinois residents who had biometric identifiers collected through Amazon products or services, including \\nAmazon Photos, Alexa, AWS cloud services, Ring, Amazon Connect, Amazon’s Flex driver app, and Amazon’s virtual try-on \\ntechnology. The complaints seek certification as class actions, unspecified amounts of damages, injunctive relief, attorneys’ \\nfees, costs, and interest. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\\nBeginning in March 2020 with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the \\nWestern District of Washington (“W.D. Wash.”), private litigants have filed a number of cases in the U.S. and Canada alleging, \\namong other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and vendors and third-party sellers in Amazon’s \\nstores, monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Attorneys \\nGeneral for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior \\nCourt of the District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the \\nprivate cases include allegations of several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through \\nAmazon’s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The \\ncomplaints seek billions of dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, \\nattorneys’ fees, and costs.

The complaint alleges, among \\nother things, that certain Amazon Prime Video features and services infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 9,648,388, 10,546,750, and \\n10,536,751, each entitled “Video-On-Demand Content Delivery System for Providing Video-On-Demand Services to TV \\nServices Subscribers”; 10,028,026, entitled “System for Addressing On-Demand TV Program Content on TV Services Platform \\nof a Digital TV Services Provider”; and 9,973,825, entitled “Dynamic Adjustment of Electronic Program Guide Displays Based \\non Viewer Preferences for Minimizing Navigation in VOD Program Selection.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of \\ndamages. In April 2022, Broadband iTV alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be \\nsubject to $166 million to $986 million in damages. In September 2022, the district court granted summary judgment, holding \\nthat the patents are invalid. In October 2022, Broadband iTV filed a notice of appeal. In September 2024, the United States \\nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment. This decision is subject to appeal.

We believe the CNPD’s decision \\nto be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.\\nIn December 2021, the Italian Competition Authority (the “ICA”) issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.à \\nr.l., Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l., Amazon EU S.à r.l., Amazon Italia Services S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming \\nthat certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy infringe EU competition rules.

We believe \\nthe ICA’s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.  \\nBeginning in October 2023, Nokia Technologies Oy and related entities filed complaints alleging infringement of patents \\nrelated to video-related technologies against Amazon.com, Inc. and related entities in multiple courts in the United States, India, \\nthe United Kingdom, Germany, and Brazil, the Unified Patent Court of the European Union, and the United States International \\nTrade Commission. The complaints allege, among other things, that certain Amazon Prime Video services and features of \\nAmazon devices carrying the Prime Video app infringe Nokia’s patents; some of the complaints additionally allege \\ninfringement by Freevee, Twitch, and Amazon voice assistants. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief and, \\nin some cases, unspecified money damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and declaratory relief. These \\nmatters are at various procedural stages, with preliminary and final injunctions issued in certain instances.

In our opinion, Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all \\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. \\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated \\nstatements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the \\nperiod ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 6, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion \\nthereon. \\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its \\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report \\non Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control \\nover financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be \\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and \\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures \\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit \\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSeattle, Washington \\nFebruary 6, 2025\\n71'),\n",
