      "In the nearly 28 years I’ve been at Amazon, the biggest difference in the relative growth of companies and\n",
      "individuals has been their aptitude to learn. At a certain point, some leaders seem to lose their thirst to learn.\n",
      "It’s hard to know the reason in each case, but it’s as if some people find it too exhausting, too time-\n",
      "consuming, or too threatening to not have all the answers. Regardless, the day we stop learning at Amazon\n",

      "Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit\n",
      "“Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is\n",
      "uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the\n",

      "Description of Business\n",
      "We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, \n",
      "consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. We serve consumers \n",
      "through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to \n",
      "grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services, and programs that allow authors, \n",
      "independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell \n",
      "content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology \n",
      "services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and \n",
      "sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through \n",
      "programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.\n",
      "We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — \n",
      "Segment Information.” \n",
      "Common Stock Split\n",
      "On May 27, 2022, we effected a 20-for-1 stock split of our common stock and proportionately increased the number of \n",
      "authorized shares of common stock. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”), and per share or per RSU information throughout \n",
      "this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a \n",
      "par value of $0.01 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split \n",
      "was reclassified from “Additional paid-in capital” to “Common stock.”\n",
      "Principles of Consolidation\n",
      "The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities \n",
      "(collectively, the “Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable \n",
      "interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our \n",
      "healthcare services. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. \n",
      "Use of Estimates\n",
      "The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the \n",

This year we have included\\nover 20 brand new cases and “greatest hits” section featuring some of the most acclaimed cases from previous Fuqua\\ncasebooks. The objective of this book is to help you prepare for your upcoming consulting case interviews. Case\\ninterviews are an integral part of the hiring process for consulting firms. These interviews give you the opportunity to\\nshowcase your communication, client, creative and analytical skills to your interviewer. This book was developed to\\ncomplement the Duke MBA Consulting Roadmap curriculum. We hope that using both will help lead you to success during\\nthe upcoming recruiting season.\\nIncluded are industry one pagers to give you an overview of each industry. Although we cannot prepare you for everything\\nyou might encounter during your case interviews we went to great lengths to diversify the case content. Current cases\\ncover a wide variety of topics from healthcare to travel, across several problem types. Finally, we have included a\\nresource page and feedback form to help you prepare and help us improve the casebook.\\nThis casebook could not have been completed without all of the wonderful cases submitted by your classmates. We\\nwould also like to thank our friends at other MBA programs for sharing with us their old casebooks to supplement the\\ncases herein.\\nWe wish you luck with your preparation and would like you to remember that your fellow DMCC members are here to\\nhelp! Please reach out to anyone on the cabinet if you feel that you are not “cracking the case”. Lastly, to the students of\\nother top MBA programs using this casebook during their preparation, we warmly welcome you to “Team Fuqua.”\\nGood luck!\\nLogan Besuden, Aniket Panda and AndrewWong  \\nThe DMCC 2016 CasebookTeam\\n3'),\n",

Furthermore, it’s feasible that Austrian clients could \\nbe served from Germany.\\n• Japan is the largest market shown and while Galactica isn’t the market leader the high sales staff utilization \\nindicates that they’re actively chasing down new leads and have high potential to grow.\\n• Egypt has the smallest revenue and while there is room to grow, there should be concern that due to low staff \\nutilization and its position as the 3rd player in the market that it may have a hard time gaining traction.\\n• Germany is the largest country in terms of revenue and the high sales utilization and top market position \\nmakes Germany look very strong.\\n2.

This exhibit is \\ndesigned to overwhelm the \\ncandidate with data so he/she \\ncan focus on the right pieces \\nof data. Allow the candidate \\nsome time to process.\\n• Hotels opened in the past 2 years:  Drumpf hotels has opened 10 (25% of total hotels as of 2 years ago) \\nnew hotels in the past 2 years which is much higher than any other chain (1%<).  This could lead to the \\nneed for increased staff as not all staff are efficient yet (2nd level insight).\\n• Location of new hotels: Drumpf hotels are all located in high cost countries, while other locations with the \\nexception of one Staroak hotel are located in lower cost labor locations (2nd level insight).\\n• Avg employees per hotel – This is what the candidate should key in on. We can see that Drumpf\\nhotels has more employees per room than any of the other hotels.  This can primarily be attributed \\nto the maid service taking a lot longer than the other hotels (45 minutes as compared to 30).  The \\ncost saving solution should center around better training for housekeeping services to bring avg. \\nservice time down to 30 minutes and the laying off of excess employees (assume 0 severance).\\n– Drumpf Hotel: 2012 (1 employee for every 6 rooms), 2015 (1 employee for every 4 rooms) \\nBilton: 1 employee for every 6 rooms (2012 & 2015)\\n– Sparriott: 1 employee for every 6 rooms (2012 & 2015)\\n– Staroak: ~1 employee for 7 to 6 rooms (2012 & 2015)\\n• Avg time to service rooms – 40 minutes in Drumpf as opposed to ~30 for other chains.  Ask candidate to \\ndiscuss why this may be the case.  If he/she is able to, he/she can mention that the opening of 10 new \\nhotels in the past 2 years is probably why there is an increased service time due to the lack of \\ntraining/familiarity per employee (2nd level insight) which leads to higher avg service time (40 min).\\n• Avg occupancy rate – This can be used in conjunction with the total number of hotels, average \\nnumber of hotel rooms, and the price elasticity of demand (if asked about from Exhibit 2) to \\ndetermine a potential increase in revenue from decreasing price per room. Price elasticity of \\ndemand of -2.0: if prices drop by $25 (10%), then demand will increase by 20% (and vice versa).  At \\nthe moment, rooms occupied is 70% or 21,000 rooms in total. Increasing this by 20% brings us to \\n25,200 rooms @ $225 ($5.67M) vs 21,000 @ $25 ($5.25M). Multiply the difference ($420k) by 360 \\ndays will give us $151.2M in increased revenue just from lowering the price.\\n• Avg Salary per Employee – Can be used to calculate potential total savings. If Drumpf is able to \\ndecrease employees to one every 6 rooms, this will be an average of 50 employees saved per \\nhotel. 50 employees * 50 hotels = 2,500 employees. 2,500 employees * Avg salary of $40k = $100M \\nin wages saved.\\n252\\nExhibit #3 Guidance: Analysis:'),\n",

Deloitte analysis indicates that DevCo should rationalize its portfolio in order to reduce overlap.  There are three primary\\nproduct lines (A, B, and C). Which product line is most attractive for DevCo?\\nANSWER CONTINUED\\nA great answer will calculate the income statement for three years using historic and forecast data to identify trends in operating income \\nand operating margin % (operating income for 2013 can be calculated without constructing the full statement – since all the costs are \\nvariable, operating income grows at the same rate as revenue):\\n• Product line C has enjoyed the fastest top-line growth, although it remains the smallest of the three, while product line B, the largest \\none, has had the slowest growth\\n• All product lines have seen operating margin declines since 2011, and stable margins in 2012-2013, with product line C having the \\nhighest margin. \\n• As a result, Product Line C is most attractive both from the total operating income perspective and from the operating margin % \\nperspective (different than the “good answer” due to forecasting with growth)  \\nThe candidate can also use the qualitative information to develop further inferences from the data.  As long as they can strongly articulate \\nthe basis for the argument, this is valid.  Examples include:\\n– Support model:  The candidate references the service models as being a key driver of profitability for the products\\n– Durability:  Product Line B has a product life that matches product line A, but at a lower price point.  This could be a key driver in \\nwhy gross margin is lower in product line B\\nProduct Line A Product Line B Product Line C\\n2011 2012 2013 2011 2012 2013 2011 2012 2013\\nRevenue (1) 800 1,000 1,200 2,200 2,250 2,363 300 600 900\\nCOGS (2) 400 600 720 1,600 1,700 1,785 100 250 375\\nSG&A (3) 120 150 180 220 225 236 60 120 180\\nOperating Income (4)=(1)-(2)-(3) 280 250 300 380 325 341 140 230 345\\nOperating Margin % (5) = (4) / (1) 35% 25% 25% 17% 14% 14% 47% 38% 38%'),\n",

Product Line leadership only wants to launch NewPro if it is profitable by the end of year 1.  \\nFOLLOW UP:  Based on this analysis and the considerations from the prior question, would you launch NewPro?  \\nA good answer will consider the viability of selling 400,000 units in year one, in addition to the brand, selling model, and risk \\nconsiderations discussed in the prior questions.  One way to justify the viability of the volume required to breakeven is for the candidate to \\ncalculate the projected revenue from NewPro at break-even and to compare it with the total Product Line B revenue in 2012. Revenues \\nfrom NewPro represent only around 3% of product line revenues, suggesting that achieving break-even in the first year is viable.\\nA great answer will not only consider the viability of selling 400,000 units in year one, but also consider the potential impact to the \\nbroader business (e.g., capacity, resourcing) and some qualitative considerations which should be explored (i.e., branding, p roduct \\noverlap, sales model).  This brings in information from the answer provided in question 1.\\nThe candidate can also mention that 100% rebate execution is a conservative assumption, and that, if execution percentage is lower, the \\ncontribution margin will be higher and less units will be required to break even.\\nFinally, the candidate can discuss the positive margin implications for Product Line B, as the margin on NewPro is significantly higher than  \\nthe average product line margin (25% from gross and 27% from net price vs. 14% average).\\nBreak-even NewPro \\nvolume Net price per unit, USD Net NewPro break-even \\nrevenue, USD MM\\nProduct Line B revenue, \\n2012, USD MM\\nNewPro break-even revenue \\nas % of Product Line B\\n(1) (2) (3)=(1)x(2) (4) (5)=(3)/(4)\\n400,000 185 74 MM 2,250 MM 3.3%'),\n",

NewPro will be positioned as “leading edge” with a high touch support model.  The product will be sold \\nthrough the third-party distributors that Product Line B utilizes.  \\nWhat should DevCo consider when deciding to launch this product?  If you were the CEO (head of all three \\nproduct lines), would you launch NewPro ?\\nA good answer will use information from previous answers to raise several considerations in addition to the output of the \\nbreakeven analysis – most information suggest that NewPro should not be launched with the current plan:\\n– Investment priorities: Given relatively slow growth and low margins, Product Line B may not be the best place to \\nspend limited investment dollars. Product Line C is most attractive (highest margin %) for DevCo, so investment \\nshould focus there.\\n– Product Overlap: Product overlap has been identified as one of the key issues to be resolved, and NewPro \\nintroduction arguably exacerbates this problem.  Being a “leading edge” product, NewPro may not align with the \\nbrand, price point, and feature set of other products from Product Line B. NewPro is more similar to Product Line A, \\nwhich could further cannibalize revenues and create customer confusion.\\n– Support Model:  Product Line B is sold through distributors with limited on site support.  A higher touch support \\nmodel, for NewPro would require additional investment from DevCo.\\nA great answer will examine mitigation strategies that would allow DevCo to realize financial and strategic opportunities \\nfrom NewPro while addressing associated risks, and highlight additional considerations, for instance:\\n– NewPro launch as part of Product Line A – the candidate should explain the fit with Product Line A and \\nunderstand that we may need some additional info, i.e. whether the product line already has similar products. Also, \\nwe have to determine whether direct sales force selling Product Line A is an appropriate channel for NewPro.\\n– Identified need for the product – if current customers of Product Line B are demanding this particular product, \\nthen investment can be a necessity to prevent customers from switching to competitors.'),\n",

The CEO wants to expand the \\ncompany’s product  line and revenues and is thinking of entering the market for surfboard wax. It hired you to \\ncalculate the market size for wax, and  your firm determined that the market size for surfboard wax is about $6m a year \\nwith about 3 million bars sold annually. Your firm  also found that the market was fairly competitive with three large \\nglobal players all based outside of Hawaii controlling about 70%  of the market smaller niche companies including a \\nfew based in Hawaii accounting for the remaining 30%.\\nThe client was impressed with our work and believes that its unique brand and connection to Hawaii will it enable it to \\nsucceed in  capturing a piece of the pie. It wants to move forward with entering the market and has now asked us to \\ndetermine how they  should enter the market for surfboard wax.  How would you think about this problem?\\nPrompt #1:\\nThe candidate should recognize that this is a market entry case and confirm this with the interviewer. If the candidate asks\\nwhat surfboard wax is, you can tell them that the wax comes in a bar form (similar to soap) and is used to coat the top of the\\nsurfboard in order to provide surfers with a surface that their feet can grip.\\nThe Framework:\\nA strong candidate’s framework should list several options for entering the market: 1) building the capability to manufacture the \\nwax by itself,\\n2) acquiring another company that manufacturers wax, 3) partnering with another company in a joint venture, 4) contracting \\nout production  and then reselling or 5) licensing its brand to another company. The candidate will then link these options to a \\nprofitability tree to estimate  whether the company can earn a return on its investment.\\nThe candidate’s profitability tree shouldhave:\\n1)Price: Candidate should show that the average price obtained by calculating $6 million/3 million bars sold = $2; or some \\nnumber around this that is  justified. The candidate can also make the case that by leveraging our client’s name in surfboards, \\nwe can command a higher price ($3 because it is  brand name and can command a premium, etc.)\\nInterviewer Guidance:\\n281'),\n",

If the candidate discusses organic growth  \\nwithin the framework, the candidate should recognize that this is likely a competitive market and estimate a reasonable market share that  \\ncompany can obtain. Reasonable estimates range from 5%-15% which translates into 150,000 to 450,000 bars sold. (Note: calculations do  \\nnot need to be in the framework; this is guidance to measure how a candidate might think aboutthis.)\\n3)Variable costs: Candidate should list out some of the components of variable cost such as materials (wax, scent, etc.) (Note: Candidate is  \\nnot expected to know materials in wax but a strong candidate will list a few to demonstrate that he/she is thinking about how to calculate  \\ncosts), packaging and shipping costs. In the case of a contract arrangement, it is assumed that variable costs are absorbed by the contractor  \\nwho will then charge the company a price per unit.\\n4)Fixed costs: Candidate should some costs such as rent, labor, SG&A, and marketing costs in order to generate sales. (Note: the  \\ncandidate should not list “costs” related to any of the options such as acquiring PPE or another company as these are fixed assets rather  \\nthan fixed costs.)\\nAfter the candidate has reviewed their framework with you, ask them to discuss qualitatively the potential up and downside of each of the  \\noptions. If the candidate is missing more than two of these options, push the candidate to think about additional market entry strategies  \\nbefore you begin this discussion. It is critical that they identify at the very least, acquiring another company and contracting out production. If  \\nthey are unable to come up with both of these scenarios, you can offer it to them as a suggestion.\\nA strong candidate will be able to succinctly articulate the costs and potential rewards associated with each option and drive the client  \\ntowards exploring an option with a hypothesis lead approach. An example might look something like: “Option 1 would involve significant  \\ninvestment in R&D and manufacturing capabilities but could earn the company the greatest return, Option 2 would be costly and logistically  \\ncomplicated but gives the company access to an established product line and distribution channels, Option 3 would spread cost and risk to  \\ntwo companies but would tie the company up with a partner in a potentially costly and complicated venture, Option 4 would enable quick  \\nproduction but would open up the company to risk should its contractor be unable or unwilling to meet demand in the future and Option 5  \\nwould provide the company with a steady revenue stream but place control of its brand into another company’s hands. Based upon my  \\nreading of the data, I recommend that we start with Option 5 as it seems to be the lowest risk\\nAfter the candidate has discussed the pros and cons of each option, go to the nextprompt.\\nInterviewer Guidance:\\n282'),\n",

By segment, North America\\nrevenue increased 10% Y oY from $353B to $387B, International revenue grew 9% Y oY from $131B to $143B,\\nand AWS revenue increased 19% Y oY , from $91B to $108B. For perspective, just 10 years ago, AWS\\nrevenue was $4.6B; and in that same year, Amazon’s total revenue was $89B.\\nAmazon’s operating income in 2024 improved 86% Y oY , from $36.9B (an operating margin of 6.4%) to\\n$68.6B (an operating margin of 10.8%). Free Cash Flow, adjusted for equipment finance leases improved\\nfrom $35.5B in 2023 to $36.2B.\\nApart from the financial results, we made our customers’ lives meaningfully better and easier. In our Stores\\nbusiness, we substantially expanded selection, continued lowering prices (independent research firm,\\nProfitero, found Amazon the lowest-priced online U.S. Retailer for the eighth year in a row), and for the\\nsecond year in a row, we shipped at record speed to our Prime members. AWS launched a slew of new\\ninfrastructure and AI services that make it even easier to build remarkable customer experiences, including\\nour latest custom AI silicon (Trainium2), a new set of frontier foundation models in Amazon Nova, and\\nsignificant expansion of available models and features in our leading Generative AI (“GenAI”) services\\nAmazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. Prime Video continued to offer compelling original shows,\\nincluding new seasons forFallout, Reacher, The Boys,and The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power, movies like\\nRoad House, The Idea of You,and Red One, live sports likeThursday Night Footballand UEFA Champions\\nLeague in Europe (with the NBA and NASCAR coming in 2025), and new selection, highlighted by Apple\\nTV+ joining Prime Video Channels. We launched a series of new Kindle devices that included a new color\\nversion, a larger Scribe option, and our fastest Paperwhites ever (the collection of which drove the highest\\nKindle unit sales for a single quarter in over a decade). And, we continued to add more selection, price\\ntransparency, and same day shipping for Amazon Pharmacy.\\nThese accomplishments are a subset of what the team launched in 2024, but represent a lot of invention,\\nhard work, and thoughtful execution across Amazon. I’m thankful for my teammates and their delivery this\\npast year (some of which you can see in our 2024 results, others of which won’t be visible for the next\\nfew years).\\nA Why Culture\\nEvery year in my annual letter, I try to share insight into what makes Amazon tick. At the highest level,\\nwe’re aiming to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, making customers’ lives better and easier every\\nday. This is not easy to do in general, let alone year after year. In fact, it’s actually quite hard, especially with\\nthe rapid rate of change in technology, customer habits, and new products from large and small companies\\nalike. If we want to have a chance at succeeding in our mission, we have to constantly question everything\\naround us.\\nWe’ve had this long-held philosophy at Amazon about two-way and one-way door decisions. A two-way\\ndoor decision is one where if you get the decision wrong, you can walk back through that door, revert to where\\nyou were, and there are few (if any) ramifications. Y ou can make these decisions quickly and locally. A one-\\nway door decision is one where it’s quite difficult (if not impossible) to walk back through that door if\\nyou get the decision wrong, so these decisions are made more methodically. But, both of these constructs\\nassume the door is unlocked. A lot of invention is about trying to open doors that have historically seemed\\nbolted shut. And, over the past 30 years, we’ve found one of the most important keys to unlock these doors\\nhas been a simple question: “Why?”'),\n",

He’s\\nalso reminded me how shortly after I joined Amazon in 1997, he tried to persuade me to work somewhere\\nmore traditional (and on the east coast closer to family)—only to realize that I’d already found the perfect fit.\\nThat’s because Amazon is a Why company. We ask why, and why not, constantly. It helps us deconstruct\\nproblems, get to root causes, understand blockers, and unlock doors that might have previously seemed\\nimpenetrable. Amazon has an unusually high quotient of this WhyQ (let’s call it “YQ”), and it frames the way\\nwe think about everything that we do.\\nStarting in 1995, we asked why can’t we offer customers every in-print book?\\nThen, we asked, why limit ourselves to in-print—why can’t we also offer every out-of-print book?\\nWhy not offer every book, ever written, in any language—all available within 60 seconds on a device that’s\\nlight and fits in the palm of your hand (Kindle)?\\nWhen we offer reviews, why must they all come from professional “experts?” Customers are great resources\\nand will be brutally honest. Why not include customer reviews even if they sometimes dissuade a purchase?\\nWhy not offer more than Books? What about Music, Video, Electronics, Tools, Kitchen, Apparel, Home\\nFurnishings?\\nWhy not practically everything?\\nWhy should we be the only sellers of these items? Millions of third-party merchants and small sellers offer\\nsimilar or unique items. Why not let customers choose the selection, price, and delivery speed they prefer from\\namong these millions of sellers?\\nAfter struggling for a couple years to create awareness for sellers’ selection, we asked ourselves why not\\nshow their selection on the same product detail pages as our first-party selection (where all the traffic was)?\\nWhy not allow our sellers to also store items in our fulfillment network, enable those items to have fast, Prime\\ndelivery, and fulfill those items for sellers (a program called Fulfillment by Amazon)?\\nWhy not experiment with relevant advertisements in our store to expose customers to new sellers and items\\n(versus only what our algorithms might surface based on past purchases)?\\nWhy does every company need their own capital-intensive datacenters and infrastructure? Why should every\\ndevelopment team keep reinventing services like compute, storage, database, and analytics? Why should\\nbuilders spend 80% of their time on the undifferentiated heavy lifting vs. their unique customer experience?\\nWhy not build a set of services (AWS) to solve that for internal and external builders?\\nWhy do I have to buy a physical video to watch a movie? Why do I need cable or linear TV to watch\\namazing TV shows (Prime Video)?\\nWhy can’t I get my Prime shipping benefits on other websites than just Amazon (Buy with Prime)?\\nI can go on. But, you get the idea. Every one of these Whys have led to significant invention, and every one\\nof them have made customers’ lives better and easier. Some of these seem obvious now. But at the time,\\nthese were provocative questions that required curiosity, risk-taking, experimentation, and persistence to\\nmake these into success stories.\\nEnabling a Why Culture\\nIf you believe having high YQ is critical to inventing for customers, how do you enable it? In my opinion,\\nit’s not solved with one mechanism. It needs to be built deeply into your culture and leadership team, and has\\nto be fiercely protected over time if you’re lucky enough to be successful. Here are a few of the strategies\\nwe employ.'),\n",

They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and\\nwork to disconfirm their beliefs.”\\nWhen we first instituted this leadership principle, some people incorrectly assumed it meant that the best\\nleaders were the ones whose ideas were chosen (i.e. they were right, a lot). It led to some people overly digging\\nin and fighting for their ideas. There’s nothing wrong with pushing for what you believe. But, in my\\nexperience, the best leaders want to hear others’ views. They don’t wilt or bristle when challenged; they’re\\nintrigued. Effective leaders change their minds when presented with new compelling information (which\\nmakes it ironic how people dismiss politicians as “flip-floppers” when they change their position). Ultimately,\\nleaders are responsible for getting to the best answer for customers, regardless of whose original idea is\\nchosen.\\nLearn and be Curious\\n“Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new\\npossibilities and act to explore them.”\\nIn the nearly 28 years I’ve been at Amazon, the biggest difference in the relative growth of companies and\\nindividuals has been their aptitude to learn. At a certain point, some leaders seem to lose their thirst to learn.\\nIt’s hard to know the reason in each case, but it’s as if some people find it too exhausting, too time-\\nconsuming, or too threatening to not have all the answers. Regardless, the day we stop learning at Amazon\\nis the day we risk undermining what we’re capable of building in the future. People with high YQ are always\\ncurious how they can get better, become wiser, and incorporate their new knowledge into better customer\\nexperiences.\\nHave Backbone; Disagree and Commit\\n“Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is\\nuncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the\\nsake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.”\\nWe don’t just empower people to challenge one another, we obligate them to do so if they disagree.\\nQuestioning, asking the hard questions, forcing the discussion (versus silently thinking a mistake is being\\nmade) is necessary to getting to better answers for customers. “I told you so” has no currency at Amazon. It’s\\nalso important to focus on the second part of this leadership principle:disagree and commit. While\\nconstructive debate is useful; at some point, teams need to make a decision and take action. From that point\\non, everybody—even those who advocated for a different solution than the one chosen—must commit to\\nmaking that decision a success. That means the team goes all in—no pocket-vetoing nor hedging between\\nother options. That’s the only way we can preserve speed and confidence that if an issue is heavily debated, the\\nteam will ultimately pull together.\\nCreate norms that support the Why.Similar to how our Leadership Principles guide our behavior, we’ve built\\nnorms over the years that guide how we work. Here are a few examples:\\nNarratives. We stopped presenting information to each other inside the company via powerpoint in 2004.\\nGiven how high level powerpoints are, we found that powerpoint was easy for the presenter to prepare, but\\nharder for the audience to understand the substantive issues. Instead, we moved to writing narratives with a\\nmaximum of six pages in the body. Narratives are harder for the presenter (it’s hard to write a thoughtful six-\\npage document that highlights the key issues in enough detail to be crisp and clear), but much easier for the\\naudience to engage with and ask the right Why questions.\\nWorking backwards documents. When we build services or features, before we start coding, we write Press\\nRelease and Frequently Asked Questions (“FAQ”) documents. The Press Release is intended to ensure that\\nwhat we’re proposing building is remarkable to customers (so we don’t get to launch and ask “wait, why\\ndid we think customers would find this interesting?”). And, the FAQ is designed to force ourselves to ask the'),\n",

The Press Release and FAQ are how we work backwards from customers, and\\nhow we push ourselves to ask questions customers would if they were in these meetings.\\nBe together whenever possible. There are many paths that can lead to breakthrough innovation. Occasionally,\\na lone genius comes up with a brilliant idea, and everyone else simply executes it. While that can work, it’s\\nnot how we typically operate. Amazon invention is deeply collaborative. It starts with a seed of an idea, then\\na group of smart, mission-driven people refine, challenge, and build on it together. And, we’ve found that\\nthis process is far more effective in person than remote. Of course, you can invent with everybody remote (and\\nsome cultures seem to prefer that). However, in my experience, it doesn’t compare to being in the same\\nroom. The energy, the pace, the spontaneous brainstorming, the willingness for people to jump in, the way\\nideas evolve in real time, and the post-meeting iteration is much better when in the same room—and yields\\nbetter outcomes for our customers and teams. With what’s happening in AI right now, and the likelihood\\nthat every customer experience we’ve ever known will be reinvented, there has never been a more important\\ntime, in my opinion, to optimize to invent well.\\nTolerating messy meetings. It’s hard to “schedule” innovation. Y ou can’t book 60 minutes to invent Amazon\\nPrime, or AWS, or Alexa+, or Fulfillment by Amazon, or Regionalization in our Fulfillment Network, or\\nProject Kuiper. These inventions are borne out of somebody asking why we can’t change what’s possible for\\ncustomers, and then they take on a life of their own, often meandering down multiple dead ends before\\ngetting to a final destination. This might bother some regimented folks. But, when we’re inventing, we accept\\nthe process being beautifully imperfect.\\nOperate like a startup (in our case, the world’s largest startup).We strive to operate like the world’s largest\\nstartup. What does that mean?\\nFirst, whatever we’re contemplating building has to be focused on solving a real customer problem or\\nmeaningfully improving a customer experience. Companies can get off track prioritizing technology because\\nthey’re excited about the technology. Great startups are on a mission to change what’s possible for customers.\\nSecond, we have a disproportionate need for builders. These are inventors. They’re people constantly\\ndissecting customer experiences, even ones that seem pretty good today, and asking why they can’t be better.\\nThey’re divinely discontent (maybe annoyingly so for team members proud of what they’ve previously\\nbuilt), and never feel like the job is done.\\nThird, we want owners. One of the strengths of Amazon over the first 30 years is that we’ve hired really\\nsmart, motivated, inventive, ambitious people who have been great owners. And, that means that our\\nteammates are constantly asking themselves, “What would I do if this was my own money?” “What would I\\ndo if I started this company and I was the majority owner?” “Hey, I know I’ve only been asked to own a\\npart of this project, but I’m not sure if the other parts are being driven well—should I stick my nose into this\\nand make sure or just trust somebody’s got it?” Owners feel accountable. They care deeply about the\\nquality and effectiveness of what they own, and view the company’s mission as their mission (we want\\nmissionaries, not mercenaries). That’s part of what our effort to increase the ratio of individual contributors\\nversus managers is about. We want flatter organizations where our owners doing the work feel like they\\nown the two-way door decisions (which are the vast majority), can move rapidly, and are fully accountable\\nfor solving the Whys of their customer experiences.\\nFourth, speed disproportionately matters for every business, in every industry, at all times. It’s a false binary\\nto argue that you can move fast or deliver high standards. If you want to be fast, you can be fast, and still\\nbe high quality. We’ve done it for many years (though we can still be faster). Speed is a leadership decision.\\nThe leadership team has to believe it’s a priority, reinforce it constantly, organize and remove structural\\nbarriers, and build in modular ways that enable pace. But, speed does not happen unless the entire company\\nand culture embrace it. We have this persistent feeling, throughout the company and in every business in\\nwhich we operate, that there are closing windows all around us. We operate in fiercely competitive market\\nsegments, with highly talented, well-funded, ambitious companies at every turn. Customers are always looking'),\n",

We spend a lot of time identifying how to unlock these experiences for them as\\nquickly as possible, and know if we don’t, somebody else will.\\nAnother way to gain speed is to eliminate bureaucracy. There is a difference between process and bureaucracy.\\nWhen you’re running something at scale, you need mechanisms to deliver the right experience and constant\\nimprovement for customers. However, as companies grow and add more managers, unneeded processes get\\nlayered on that add little value. Last fall, I asked teammates across the company to send me bureaucracy\\nexamples that they were experiencing. I’ve received almost 1,000 of these emails, and read every single one.\\nBuilders hate bureaucracy. It slows them down, frustrates them, and keeps them from doing what they came\\nhere to do. As leaders, we don’t always see the red tape buried deep in our organizations, but we can sure\\nas heck eliminate it when we do. We’ve already made over 375 changes based on this feedback. We need to\\nmove fast, and we are committed to rooting out bureaucracy that ties up time and dispirits our teammates.\\nFifth, you have to be scrappy. As businesses succeed and get larger, they sometimes forget how things got\\nstarted. We built Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) with 13 people; Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud\\n(EC2) with 11 people. Managers can confuse themselves that the way to grow and get ahead is to accumulate\\nlarge teams. Historically, we’ve had periods where we’ve allowed this thinking to hold sway. But, it’s not the\\nway we fundamentally think about building teams and products, and have adjusted to reflect that again. Our\\nbest leaders get the most done with the least number of resources required to do the job. They pride\\nthemselves on being lean.\\nSixth, you have to be willing to take risks. This sounds easier than it is. Y ou need clever enough people to\\nidentify worthwhile bets. And if you have these inventive, ambitious builders with high standards, they’re not\\nused to failure. They suspect external (and maybe internal) ridicule awaits them if they try something very\\ndifferent that doesn’t work out. So, people often play it safe. But, you can’t achieve something extraordinary\\nfor customers by playing “not to lose.” If your Whys take you down an invention path that delivers an\\nexperience that doesn’t look like what’s been done before, let customer obsession be your compass. Y ou rarely,\\nif ever, change the world by doing the same thing as everybody else.\\nAnd finally, you have to care most about delivering compelling results for customers. It’s not how charismatic\\nyou are. It’s not whether you’re really good at managing up or sideways. What matters is what we actually\\nget done for customers. That’s what we want to reward.\\nNext generation Whys\\nWhile the team and I feel quite optimistic about the progress and potential of our existing businesses, we\\nhave plenty of new Whys we’re asking. Below are a few of them and some quick thoughts.\\nWhy is AI so important? Will it really have as much impact as some claim and when?\\nGenerative AI is going to reinvent virtually every customer experience we know, and enable altogether new\\nones about which we’ve only fantasized. The early AI workloads being deployed focus on productivity and\\ncost avoidance (e.g. customer service, business process orchestration, workflow, translation, etc.). This is\\nsaving companies a lot of money. Increasingly, you’ll see AI change the norms in coding, search, shopping,\\npersonal assistants, primary care, cancer and drug research, biology, robotics, space, financial services,\\nneighborhood networks—everything. Some of these areas are already seeing rapid progress; others are still\\nin their infancy. But, if your customer experiences aren’t planning to leverage these intelligent models, their\\nability to query giant corpuses of data and quickly find your needle in the haystack, their ability to keep\\ngetting smarter with more feedback and data, and their future agentic capabilities, you will not be competitive.\\nHow soon? It won’t all happen in a year or two, but, it won’t take ten either. It’s moving faster than almost\\nanything technology has ever seen.'),\n",

That’s why\\nthere are more than 1,000 GenAI applications being built across Amazon, aiming to meaningfully change\\ncustomer experiences in shopping, coding, personal assistants, streaming video and music, advertising,\\nhealthcare, reading, and home devices, to name a few. It’s also why AWS is quickly developing the key\\nprimitives (or building blocks) for AI development, such as custom silicon AI chips in Amazon Trainium to\\nprovide better price-performance on training and inference, highly flexible model-building and inference\\nservices in Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock, our own frontier models in Amazon Nova to provide\\nlower cost and latency for customers’ applications, and agent creation and management capabilities.\\nThere is also substantial capital investment required. In AWS, the faster demand grows, the more datacenters,\\nchips, and hardware we need to procure (and AI chips are much more expensive than CPU chips). We\\nspend this capital upfront, even though these assets are useful for many years (in the case of datacenters, for\\nat least 15-20 years). We only start monetizing this capital investment many months after we spend the\\ncapital, and over many years—which leads to attractive long-term FCF and ROIC (as people have seen in\\nAWS over the last several years). But in periods, like now, of unusually high demand (our AI revenue is\\ngrowing at triple digit Y oY percentages and represents a multi-billion-dollar annual revenue run rate), you’re\\ndeploying a lot of capital. We continue to believe AI is a once-in-a-lifetime reinvention of everything we\\nknow, the demand is unlike anything we’ve seen before, and our customers, shareholders, and business will\\nbe well-served by our investing aggressively now.\\nWhy do chips and AI have to be this expensive for customers?\\nAI does not have to be as expensive as it is today, and it won’t be in the future. Chips are the biggest culprit.\\nMost AI to date has been built on one chip provider. It’s pricey. Trainium should help, as our new Trainium2\\nchips offer 30-40% better price-performance than the current GPU-powered compute instances generally\\navailable today. While model training still accounts for a large amount of the total AI spend, inference\\n(which are the predictions or outputs of the models) will represent the overwhelming majority of future AI\\ncost because customers train their models periodically, but produce inferences constantly in large-scale AI\\napplications. Inference will become another building block service, along with compute, storage, database,\\nand others. We feel strong urgency to make inference less expensive for customers. More price-performant\\nchips will help. But, inference will also get meaningfully more efficient in the next couple of years with\\nimprovements in model distillation, prompt caching, computing infrastructure, and model architectures.\\nReducing the cost per unit in AI will unleash AI being used as expansively as customers desire, and also lead\\nto more overall AI spending. It’s like what happened with AWS. Revolutionizing the cost of compute and\\nstorage happily led to lower cost per unit, and more invention, better customer experiences, and more absolute\\ninfrastructure spend.\\nWhy have personal assistants not yet taken off? How can Alexa help?\\nA great personal assistant can answer virtually any question and get things done on your behalf. There have\\nbeen no digital solutions that can do both yet. That is, until Alexa+ arrived. Alexa+ is not only comparably\\nintelligent to the leading chatbots, but can take a plethora of real actions for you. She can play music, play\\nvideo, move media from one of your devices to another, set alarms and timers, control your smart home,\\norder across hundreds of millions of ecommerce items, make reservations for restaurants or Ubers, order\\nconcert tickets, alert you when your favorite artist announces a tour, find a plumber to fix your sink, and\\nmemorize whatever you’ve done on Amazon. This is pretty game-changing for consumers, and just the start of\\nwhat Alexa+ will do. We have over 600 million Alexa devices out there today, and expect Alexa+ to play\\nan even more vital role in the lives of these hundreds of millions of customers in the future.\\nWhy can’t we get items to customers even faster? Does it matter?\\nEvery year, people ask whether we’ve reached the law of diminishing returns on speed of delivery. Our data\\nshows this not to be the case. When we promise faster delivery times, customers complete purchases at a\\nmeaningfully higher rate and shop with us more frequently. Amazon Prime started with unlimited, free, two-\\nday delivery for a million products; it’s now grown to over 300 million items, with tens of millions available'),\n",

An increasing number of deliveries happen same day. This speed improvement is\\nprimarily due to our regionalization redesign of our fulfillment network, our new placement algorithms, and\\nthe introduction of our innovative same-day fulfillment centers. Although we’ve set speed records for two\\nconsecutive years, we’re still honing these innovations, and have others planned. And, don’t forget Prime Air,\\nour drones that will get items to customers inside an hour. We are not done improving speed.\\nWhy can’t people in small towns enjoy the same fast delivery speeds as people in cities?\\nAs some other companies are abandoning small-town customers due to cost to serve, we’re going the other\\nway—we’re investing to serve our rural customers even better. We’ve already expanded Same-Day and\\nOvernight Delivery to dozens of smaller cities and towns across the U.S., with more coming. This expansion\\nwill provide even faster Amazon delivery speeds for many millions of customers, particularly in less\\ndensely populated areas, enabling us to deliver over a billion packages each year to customers living in\\n13,000 zip codes spanning 1.2 million square miles.\\nRelated, why can’t we help the hundreds of millions of people without broadband connectivity?\\nThere are about 400-500 million households around the world, most in small, rural towns that don’t have\\naccess to broadband connectivity. They can’t leverage the Internet to learn, shop, do business, access\\nentertainment, and communicate the same way people take for granted in bigger cities. This digital divide is\\nwhat Project Kuiper, our low Earth orbit satellite network, aims to solve. We’re just launching our first\\nproduction satellites, and will ultimately have over 3,200 in orbit over the next few years. While capital-\\nintensive to launch, we believe Kuiper will be a meaningful operating income and ROIC business for us.\\nWhy does healthcare have to be so stressful?\\nHealthcare, especially in the U.S., is quite frustrating. It’s hard to get fast appointments with primary care\\nphysicians, often harder with specialists. There’s a lot of waiting around. Physicians spend only a few minutes\\nwith patients. Then, patients have to drive somewhere (often not close) to get their medications. And, when\\nthey get to the pharmacy, they’re often surprised by the pricing, what’s covered by their insurance, and what\\nyou can easily access that’s not behind a locked shelf. Customers deserve better. It’s why you see such\\npositive customer sentiment and growth for Amazon Pharmacy and Amazon One Medical, and we continue\\nto iterate quickly on selection and transparency for Amazon Pharmacy, and physical clinic capacity for\\nOne Medical.\\nThese are some of the Why questions we’re asking ourselves right now, and I’m excited about the future\\ninventions to come. We’re not going to be bored any time soon.\\nWhen I first started working, I thought it was unfathomable that my Dad worked at the same place for\\n45 years. How could that be? That’s so long. I used to tell my friends that would never be me. Now, with almost\\n28 years and counting at Amazon, I have to answer those same friends with their own Why question.\\nAfter all these years, why are you still at Amazon?\\nI’m obviously a Superfan, but there are several compelling parts to working at Amazon. First, I’m not sure\\nthat any company prioritizes customers as relentlessly as we do. Lots of companies say they will; few follow\\nthrough. Second, it’s challenging to find a company where you can make a bigger impact on the world\\nthan you can at Amazon. Third, we make significant long-term investments and bets in both inventions and\\npeople. This allows our teams to iterate on ideas, and make the right long-term decisions for customers\\nand the company. And, I’ve never encountered a more intelligent, creative, ambitious, hungry, hard-working,\\nand missionary group of teammates than we have at Amazon. In my opinion, this is a remarkable set of\\nqualities to have at a company. And, for builders who want to change the world, and who have fire in their\\nbelly, there’s no better place to be than Amazon.'),\n",

Today, online commerce saves\\ncustomers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the\\nvery process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so,\\nhopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.\\nWe have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity\\nand as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive\\nlandscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings\\nand have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move\\nquickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities\\nin other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without\\nrisk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.\\nIt’s All About the Long Term\\nWe believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over thelong\\nterm. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position.\\nThe stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate\\ndirectly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on\\ninvested capital.\\nOur decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most\\nindicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to\\npurchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest\\naggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an\\nenduring franchise.\\nBecause of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than\\nsome companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making\\napproach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:\\n• We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.\\n• We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations\\nrather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.\\n• We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to\\njettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work\\nbest. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.'),\n",

We know our success will be largely\\naffected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like,\\nand therefore must actually be, an owner.\\nWe aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we\\nwould be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.\\nWith this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our\\noutlook for the future.\\nObsess Over Customers\\nFrom the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the\\nWeb was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply\\ncould not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than\\nwas possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-\\nto-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged\\nfocus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer\\ncustomers gift certificates, 1-Click\\nSM shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and\\nrecommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth\\nremains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers\\nhave placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader\\nin online bookselling.\\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\\n• Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.\\n• Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.\\n• The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to\\nover 58% in the same period in 1997.\\n• In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the\\ntop 20.\\n• We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America\\nOnline, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.'),\n",

The\\nchallenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:\\naggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of\\nproduct and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market\\nopportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to\\nbe a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about\\nwhat we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\\n1997 was indeed an incredible year.

These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. \\nInformation on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — \\nSegment Information.”\\nConsumers\\nWe serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design \\nour stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product \\ncategories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically \\nvisiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, Ring, Blink, \\nand eero, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-\\nto-use functionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer subscription services such as Amazon Prime, a \\nmembership program that includes fast, free shipping on tens of millions of items, access to award-winning movies and series, \\nlive sports, and other benefits.\\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks \\nthat we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. \\nWe operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, \\n“Properties.”\\nSellers\\nWe offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using \\nour services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity \\nfees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.\\nDevelopers and Enterprises\\nWe serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, \\nthrough AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and \\nmachine learning, and other services. \\nContent Creators\\nWe offer programs that allow authors, independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app \\ndevelopers, and others to publish and sell content.\\nAdvertisers\\nWe provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored \\nads, display, and video advertising.\\n3'),\n",

The worldwide \\nmarketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from \\nmany different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and \\nomnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to \\nconsumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and \\nall distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, virtual \\nassistants, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in \\ncollaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, \\nomnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment \\nprocessing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or \\noffline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based \\ninfrastructure, tools and services relating to artificial intelligence, and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, \\nmarket, or sell consumer electronics, communications, and other electronic devices and services; (8) companies that sell grocery \\nproducts online and in physical stores; (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats; and \\n(10) providers of virtual or in-person healthcare services. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail \\nbusinesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for \\nour seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ \\nability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, \\nlonger histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. \\nThey may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that \\nrestrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive \\nterms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The internet facilitates competitive \\nentry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. \\nEach of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and \\nwell-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their \\ncompetitive positions.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary \\ntechnologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, \\ntrade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to \\nprotect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain \\nnames, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications \\ncovering certain of our proprietary technology. \\nSeasonality\\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, \\nwhich ends December 31. \\nHuman Capital\\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2024, we \\nemployed approximately 1,556,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and \\ntemporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software \\nengineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for \\npersonnel across other parts of our business.\\nWe strive to be Earth’s best employer. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement this objective and \\ninvent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills \\ntraining and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (education funding for eligible employees). Over 240,000 \\nAmazon employees around the world have participated in Career Choice. We also continue to inspect and refine the \\nmechanisms we use to hire, develop, evaluate, and retain our employees. In addition, safety is integral to everything we do at \\nAmazon and we continue to invest in safety improvements such as capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety \\ncontrols, and engineering ergonomic solutions. Our safety team is dedicated to using the science of safety to solve complex \\nproblems and establish new industry best practices. We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and \\nhave deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.\\n4'),\n",

Risk Factors\\nPlease carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an \\ninvestment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may \\nor may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, \\nreputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, \\nliquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by \\nfactors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant \\nrisks to our operations. In addition to the factors discussed in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of \\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in the risk factors below, global economic and geopolitical conditions and \\nadditional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below. \\nMany of the risks discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on us.\\nBusiness and Industry Risks\\nWe Face Intense Competition\\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, \\nincluding cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-\\ncommerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, \\nhealthcare, communications, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have \\ngreater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched \\nproducts and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive \\npricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\\nCompetition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and \\nwell-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in \\nother market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including \\nsearch, web and infrastructure computing services, practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, digital \\ncontent, satellites, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The internet facilitates competitive entry and \\ncomparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result \\nof competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may \\nbe required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.\\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks\\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or \\nservice offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if \\ncustomers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by, service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or \\nquality issues. In addition, profitability or other intended benefits, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, \\nand we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often \\nsignificant. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the \\n6'),\n",

In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for \\na variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully \\nplan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation.\\nOur International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks\\nOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In \\ncertain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-\\nmarket advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and \\npromote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.\\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of \\nrisks, including:\\n• local economic and political conditions;\\n• government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive \\ngovernmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and \\ntariffs, and restrictions around the import and export of certain products, technologies, and components); \\nnationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;\\n• restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, \\nservices, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal \\nprecedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media \\nproducts and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\\n• business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, electronic devices, and \\ncommunications services;\\n• limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\\n• limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;\\n• shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\\n• laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, \\nconsumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\\n• lower levels of use of the internet;\\n• lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;\\n• lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;\\n• difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural \\ndifferences;\\n• different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;\\n• compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting \\ncorrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;\\n• laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and\\n• geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.\\nAs international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will \\nintensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive \\nadvantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local \\nbrand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.\\nThe People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in \\ncountry through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the internet, IT \\ninfrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products \\nand services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide \\ncertain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide \\nservices. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online \\nmulti-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-\\nparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a \\nthird-party seller on the www.amazon.in marketplace.

There are substantial \\nuncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will \\nultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to \\ncontinue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships \\nwe or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the \\ninterpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other \\nfinancial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely. \\nIn addition, because China-based sellers account for significant portions of our third-party seller services and advertising \\nrevenues, and China-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods, regulatory and trade \\nrestrictions, data protection and cybersecurity laws, economic factors, geopolitical events, security issues, or other factors \\nnegatively impacting China-based sellers and suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.\\nThe Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations\\nDemand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, \\npromotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to global economic conditions such as recessionary \\nfears or rising inflation, natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a \\nresult of climate change), or geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur \\nduring our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet \\ncustomer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be \\nrequired to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce \\nprofitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and \\nadditional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our \\nwebsites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites \\nunavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the \\nattractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and \\ncustomer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-\\nsourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network \\noptimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.\\nAs a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \\nbalances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing \\nactivities) because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores and the related receivables settle quickly. Typically, there \\nis also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases and third-party seller sales. \\nOur accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as vendors and sellers are paid, \\nresulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.\\nWe Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers\\nThe law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have \\nin the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we \\nmaintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers \\nnever receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions, \\nand to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling \\ngoods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When \\nthese policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation \\nand we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may \\nreimburse customers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of \\nthis program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. \\nWe Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing \\nIntellectual Property Rights of Third Parties\\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and \\nsimilar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret \\nprotection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary \\nrights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made \\navailable. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. \\nFurthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights.

The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. \\nMoreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third \\nparties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently \\ndevelop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\\nWe have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged \\ninfringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties.

Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks \\nhave been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, our and \\nour customers’ development and use of artificial intelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims, \\nincluding those based on unauthorized use of third-party technology or content.\\nOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital \\ncontent. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and \\ncontent providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.\\nWe Have Foreign Exchange Risk\\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and \\nproduct and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may \\ndiffer materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany \\nbalances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also \\nhold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and \\nJapanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \\nbalances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.\\nOperating Risks\\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\\nWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service \\nofferings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses.

For example, we \\nrely on a limited group of suppliers for semiconductor products, including products related to artificial intelligence \\ninfrastructure such as graphics processing units.

In addition, violations by our suppliers \\nor other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain \\nStandards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our \\nreputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\\nOur Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks\\nWe provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through \\ncommercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, \\ntechnology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services \\nthrough our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other \\nresource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, \\nand develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, \\ninventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third \\nparties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially \\ndependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are not successful, the \\ncompensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to \\nenter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject \\nto claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or \\ndeveloping these services.\\nAs our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We \\nmay in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their \\ncontractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.\\nOur present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such \\nas:\\n• disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\\n• impairment of other relationships;\\n• variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and\\n• difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.\\n12'),\n",

The \\nmedia, political, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks. \\nClaims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of \\nOperations\\nAs an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we \\nare regularly subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including \\nproceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual \\nproperty matters, taxes, labor and employment (including the characterization of delivery drivers), competition and antitrust, \\nprivacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, \\ngoods and services offered by us and by third parties (including artificial intelligence technologies and services), healthcare, and \\nother matters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope \\nand geographic reach, as our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more \\npeople, and as governments and regulatory authorities seek to regulate us on a pre-emptive basis. For example, we are litigating \\na number of matters alleging price fixing, monopolization, and consumer protection claims, including those brought by state \\nattorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us \\nbecause of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. \\nThe outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves \\nor possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable \\noutcomes.

Although we maintain \\nliability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will \\ncontinue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that \\nare intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for \\nbreaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from \\nproduct liability.\\nWe Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations\\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign \\njurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for \\ntax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to \\ntax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. \\nSuch changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions \\nare considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, \\ntargeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect \\nsales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result \\nin liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising \\nand marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader \\ninternational tax reform is implemented. In addition, the European Union and other countries (including those in which we \\noperate) have enacted or have committed to enact global minimum taxes, which may increase our tax expense.\\nOur results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or \\nretroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to \\nprovide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government \\nagencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly \\ncomply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.\\nOur tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, \\ninvestments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, \\nlosses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or \\nextraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income \\nand loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the \\nordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is \\nuncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.\\nWe are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. \\nDevelopments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash \\nflows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Due to the \\ninherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial, \\nadministrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially \\ndifferent from our expectations. For example, the Indian tax authority has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to \\nAmazon in the U.S. We are contesting this position; however, if this matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay \\nadditional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. We regularly assess the \\nlikelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals.

We are subject to audits and \\ninvestigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and \\nadministrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment \\nof fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business.

We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-\\nlooking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. \\nActual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign \\nexchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional \\nlabor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and \\nemerging technologies, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, \\nthe mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the \\nextent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, \\ninternational growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, \\nfulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree \\nto which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic \\ntransactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical \\nconditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. \\nThese risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ \\nsignificantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”\\nOverview\\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered \\nthrough our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, \\nand we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from \\nitems we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as \\nservice sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product \\ncategories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, \\nand digital content subscriptions.\\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by \\nincreasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital \\nexpenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily \\nresult from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by \\ninvestments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer \\nexperience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including \\nlowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original \\ncontent, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving \\nreliability, and earning customer trust. See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional \\ninformation on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.\\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product \\nand content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, \\ntransportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs \\ninclude the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online \\nstores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment network. Variable costs \\ngenerally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, \\ngeographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to \\nlower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our \\nprocesses. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.\\nWe seek to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before our payments to vendors and sellers become due. \\nBecause consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. We expect \\nvariability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales \\nby us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, \\nsupply chain disruptions and resulting vendor lead times, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent \\nto which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over \\ntime since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix \\n20'),\n",

Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital \\nspending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-\\nfunctionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and infrastructure, \\nincluding AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in infrastructure to \\nenhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the \\nspeed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical \\napplications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users’ experience on the internet and \\nincrease its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in \\nAWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine \\nlearning, and other services to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy \\ninnovative and efficient software and electronic devices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite \\nnetwork for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. \\nWe seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, \\nsuch as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock \\nunits as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests \\nof our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards \\noutstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 10.8 billion \\nand 10.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\\nOur financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our \\nreported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our \\ninternational locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained \\nconstant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our \\nconsolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our \\nincreasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders \\nover the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of \\ncurrency changes.\\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the \\neffect of movements in foreign exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either \\npositively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.\\nFor additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and \\nSupplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.”\\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a discussion and analysis of our \\nfinancial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s \\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States \\n(“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, \\nand related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical \\naccounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation \\nuncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of \\nthe Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have \\nother key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to \\nunderstanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — \\nNote 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.” Although we believe that our \\nestimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may \\ndiffer significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\\nInventories\\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and \\nare valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value.

Our foreign \\ncurrency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupees, and Japanese Yen. \\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $84.9 billion and $115.9 billion in 2023 and 2024. Our operating cash \\nflows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and \\nadvertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and \\nrelated transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments.

Our \\nlong-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. \\nHowever, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of \\ninterest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.  \\nWe generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities and AAA-\\nrated money market funds.

In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, \\nconsisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. We serve consumers \\nthrough our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to \\ngrow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services, and programs that allow authors, \\nindependent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell \\ncontent. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology \\nservices, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and \\nsell electronic devices. In addition, we provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through \\nprograms such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — \\nSegment Information.” \\nCommon Stock Split\\nOn May 27, 2022, we effected a 20-for-1 stock split of our common stock and proportionately increased the number of \\nauthorized shares of common stock. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”), and per share or per RSU information throughout \\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a \\npar value of $0.01 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split \\nwas reclassified from “Additional paid-in capital” to “Common stock.”\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities \\n(collectively, the “Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable \\ninterest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our \\nhealthcare services. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. \\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the \\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the \\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives \\nof equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation \\nforfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and \\noperating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video \\ncontent. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing \\nbasis. \\nIn Q4 2024, we completed a useful life study for certain types of heavy equipment and are increasing the useful life from \\nten years to thirteen years for such equipment effective January 1, 2025. Based on heavy equipment included in “Property and \\nequipment, net” as of December 31, 2024, we estimate an increase in 2025 operating income of approximately $0.9 billion, \\nwhich will be recorded primarily in “Fulfillment” and impact our North America and International segments.\\nWe completed our most recent servers and networking equipment useful life study in Q4 2024, and are changing the \\nuseful lives of a subset of our servers and networking equipment, effective January 1, 2025, from six years to five years. For \\nthose assets included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2024, whose useful life will change from six years \\nto five years, we anticipate a decrease in 2025 operating income of approximately $0.7 billion. We expect to continue to acquire \\nmore of these server and networking assets in 2025. In 2024, we also determined, primarily in the fourth quarter, to retire early \\ncertain of our servers and networking equipment. We recorded approximately $920 million of accelerated depreciation and \\nrelated charges for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 related to these decisions. The accelerated depreciation will continue \\ninto 2025 and decrease operating income by approximately $0.6 billion in 2025. These two changes above are due to an \\nincreased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\\nWe had previously increased the useful life of our servers from five years to six years effective January 1, 2024. The \\neffect of this change for the year ended December 31, 2024, based on servers that were included in “Property and equipment, \\n41'),\n",

The commissions and any related fulfillment and \\nshipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon \\ndelivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. \\nAdvertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through \\nprograms such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the \\nnumber of clicks or impressions.\\nSubscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to \\ncontent including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime \\nmemberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. \\nSubscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized \\nover the subscription period.\\nAWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is \\nallocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based \\non the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including \\ncompute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales \\ncommissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\\nOther - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as healthcare services, certain licensing and \\ndistribution of video content, and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when \\ncontent is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed.\\nReturn Allowances \\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for \\nreturn allowances are included in “Accrued expenses and other” and were $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.4 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additions to the allowance were $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion, and $5.5 billion and deductions \\nfrom the allowance were $5.2 billion, $5.1 billion, and $5.5 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Included in “Inventories” on our \\nconsolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $948 million, $992 million, and $998 million as of December 31, 2022, 2023, \\nand 2024, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances. \\nCost of Sales\\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, \\nincluding costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media \\ncontent costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers \\nare included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and \\nrelated transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated \\nstatements of operations.\\nVendor Agreements\\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, \\nincentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we \\npay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost \\nof services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We \\nevaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates \\ncan be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.\\n43'),\n",

Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us \\nin fulfillment and customer service operations.\\nTechnology and Infrastructure\\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and \\ndevelopment of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and \\ndisplay of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include \\nservers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses \\nnecessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses.

Under this method, approximately 50% of the grant date fair value is \\nrecognized as expense in the first year of grant for the majority of our stock-based compensation awards. The accelerated \\nmethod also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If an award is forfeited early in its life, \\nthe adjustment to compensation expense is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. The \\nestimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated \\nestimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates \\nare revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience. \\nAdditionally, we have stock-based compensation awards that are expected to settle in cash.

(“Rivian”). Our \\ninvestment in Rivian’s preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or \\nimpairments, prior to Rivian’s initial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock \\nto Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2024, we held 158 million shares of Rivian’s Class A common stock, \\nrepresenting an approximate 14% ownership interest, and an approximate 13% voting interest. We determined that we have the \\nability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the \\npurchase of electric vehicles and jointly-owned intellectual property, and one of our employees serving on Rivian’s board of \\ndirectors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in “Marketable \\nsecurities” on our consolidated balance sheets, and had a fair value of $3.7 billion and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2023 and \\nDecember 31, 2024. The investment was subject to regulatory sales restrictions resulting in a discount for lack of marketability \\nof approximately $800 million as of December 31, 2021, which expired in Q1 2022.\\nIncome Taxes\\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and \\nlosses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We \\nintend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely \\noutside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such \\namounts.  \\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and \\nliabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates \\nexpected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are \\nevaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We \\nconsider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative \\nloss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods \\navailable to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. \\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (income tax contingencies). \\nThe first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is \\nmore likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The \\nsecond step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate \\nsettlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require \\nperiodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our \\nincome tax contingencies in income tax expense.\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly \\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date.

These valuations require significant judgment.\\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in \\nactive markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of \\nsecurities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from \\nor corroborated by observable market data. \\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\\nInventories\\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and \\nare valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently \\navailable information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product \\nvendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, \\nrepresenting a write-down of inventory, was $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\\nWe provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers \\nmaintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and \\ntherefore these products are not included in our inventories.\\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to \\nprovide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead \\ntimes and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain \\nelectronic device components. We have certain non-cancellable purchase commitments arising from these agreements. These \\ncommitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. \\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Other\\nIncluded in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to \\ncustomers, vendors, and prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, customer receivables, \\nnet, were $34.1 billion and $34.3 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $8.5 billion and $11.6 billion, and other receivables, net, \\nwere $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion. Prepaid expenses and other current assets, which include amounts related to non-income \\ntaxes and satellite network launch services deposits, were $5.4 billion and $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and \\nDecember 31, 2024. We currently expense satellite network launch services deposits upon launch to “Technology and \\ninfrastructure.” \\nWe estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. \\nReceivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected \\nin accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.4 billion, $1.7 billion, and $2.0 \\nbillion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additions to the allowance were $1.6 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.9 billion, \\nand deductions to the allowance were $1.3 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nWe incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use \\nsoftware, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, \\nincluding those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred. \\nProperty and Equipment, Net\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from \\nproperty and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, \\nalong with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the \\nconstruction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, \\nheavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the \\nestimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, five years \\n46'),\n",

Depreciation and amortization expense is \\nclassified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations. \\nLeases\\nWe categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are \\ngenerally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired \\nunder finance leases are recorded in “Property and equipment, net.” All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our \\nleases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property.\\nCertain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of \\nproperty, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are \\naccounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone \\nprices.\\nLease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a \\ndiscount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present \\nvalue of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease \\nprepayments reclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and \\namortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.\\nWhen we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase \\nthe leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the \\nclassification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes \\nin price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred. \\nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the \\nterm of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the \\nestimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. \\nThe interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method \\nover the lease term.\\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the \\ntermination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded \\nliabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\\nFinancing Obligations\\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have \\ncontrol over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the \\narrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful \\nlife or the term of the obligation. \\nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are \\nderecognized, and we classify the lease as operating. \\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event \\noccurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative \\nassessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset \\nis less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and \\nindefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, \\nwe recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash \\nflows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily \\non expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible \\nassets as of April 1, 2024, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their \\ncarrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test.

These incentives are \\nrecorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or expenses.\\nDigital Video and Music Content\\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing \\nagreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the \\nlicense fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we \\nrecognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we \\namortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line \\nbasis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are \\nexpensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to \\n“Cost of sales” predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content. \\nThe weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.1 years. We review usage and viewing patterns \\nimpacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively. \\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each \\nmajor geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships.

Such investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the \\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets.  \\nMarketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses \\nincluded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair \\nvalue below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a \\nforecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through “Other income (expense), net” on our \\nconsolidated statements of operations.\\nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair \\nvalue option, are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with \\nchanges recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations.\\nNon-Marketable Investments\\nNotes that are convertible to equity classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and \\nlosses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Credit losses, if any, are recorded as an allowance \\nthrough “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Upon conversion, the amount of the notes \\nreported at fair value are reclassified generally from available-for-sale to equity investments accounted for at cost, with any \\nassociated unrealized gain or loss reclassified from “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” to “Other income \\n(expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. \\nIn Q3 2023, we invested in a $1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. In Q1 2024, we \\ninvested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. In Q4 2024, we entered into an agreement and invested $1.3 billion in a \\nthird convertible note, and will invest an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025.

Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/\\nacquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its \\nestimated fair value. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, these investments had a carrying value of $754 million and $989 \\nmillion.\\nEquity investments where we can exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee are accounted for using \\nthe equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value option. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported \\nby equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, are recognized in \\n“Equity-method investment activity, net of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we \\nevaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are other-than-temporary and if so, we write down the investment \\nto its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, these investments had a carrying value of $614 million and $1.2 \\nbillion.\\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, equity warrants measured at fair value were $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion, with \\nchanges recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are \\nclassified as Level 2 and 3 assets. \\nThese non-marketable investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets.\\nCertain of our investments represent a variable interest in an entity. We do not consolidate the entities in which we hold \\nthese investments because we are not the primary beneficiary. \\nLong-Lived Assets\\nLong-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever \\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that \\nwould necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a \\nsignificant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate \\nthat the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.\\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying \\namount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss \\nbased on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale \\nwhen certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for \\nsale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at \\nthe lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\\nAccrued Expenses and Other\\nIncluded in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to tax-\\nrelated liabilities, leases and asset retirement obligations, self-insurance liabilities, payroll and related expenses, current debt, \\nunredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, marketing liabilities, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.\\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $7.7 billion and $7.5 billion and our \\nliabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $5.3 billion and $5.4 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by \\na customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns.\\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities\\nAlthough we maintain certain high-deductible, third-party insurance coverage for catastrophic losses, we effectively self-\\ninsure for exposure primarily related to workers’ compensation, employee healthcare benefits, general and product liability, and \\nautomobile liability, including liability resulting from third-party transportation service providers. We estimate self-insurance \\nliabilities by considering historical claims experience, frequency and costs of claims, projected claims development, inflation, \\nand other actuarial assumptions. Changes in the number or costs of claims, healthcare costs, judgment and settlement amounts, \\nassociated legal expenses, and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. In the fourth \\nquarter of 2022, we increased our reserves for general, product, and automobile liabilities by $1.3 billion primarily driven by \\nchanges in our estimates about the costs of asserted and unasserted claims, which was primarily recorded in “Cost of sales” on \\nour consolidated statements of operations and impacted our North America segment.

The complaint alleged, among other things, that \\n“Alexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices” infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled “Natural Language Interface \\nUsing Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.” The complaint sought an injunction, an unspecified amount of \\ndamages, enhanced damages\\n, an ongoing royalty, interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. In March 2023, the plaintiffs alleged in \\ntheir damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $140 million to $267 million in \\ndamages. In March 2024, the district court granted summary judgment ruling that the patent is invalid and dismissed the case. \\nIn April 2024, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and will continue to defend \\nourselves vigorously in this matter.\\nIn December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District \\nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleged, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe \\nU.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, each entitled “Network Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol”; and \\n7,233,978, entitled “Method and Apparatus for Managing Location Information in a Network Separate from the Data to Which \\nthe Location Information Pertains.” The complaint sought an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ \\nfees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In April 2024, a jury found that Amazon infringed the asserted patents and awarded \\nKove $525 million in damages. In August 2024, the court awarded Kove $148 million in pre-judgment interest. In September \\n2024, we filed a notice of appeal. We disagree with the jury’s findings and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this \\nmatter. \\nBeginning in June 2019 with Wilcosky v. Amazon.com, Inc., now pending in the United States District Court for the \\nNorthern District of Illinois (“N.D. Ill.”), private litigants have filed a number of cases in U.S. federal and state courts, \\nincluding Hogan v. Amazon.com, Inc. (N.D. Ill.), alleging, among other things, that Amazon’s collection, storage, use, \\nretention, and protection of biometric identifiers violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The complaints allege \\npurported classes of Illinois residents who had biometric identifiers collected through Amazon products or services, including \\nAmazon Photos, Alexa, AWS cloud services, Ring, Amazon Connect, Amazon’s Flex driver app, and Amazon’s virtual try-on \\ntechnology. The complaints seek certification as class actions, unspecified amounts of damages, injunctive relief, attorneys’ \\nfees, costs, and interest. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\\nBeginning in March 2020 with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the \\nWestern District of Washington (“W.D.

Attorneys \\nGeneral for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior \\nCourt of the District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the \\nprivate cases include allegations of several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through \\nAmazon’s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The \\ncomplaints seek billions of dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, \\nattorneys’ fees, and costs. The Federal Trade Commission and a number of state Attorneys General filed a similar lawsuit in \\nSeptember 2023 in the W.D.

In April 2022, Broadband iTV alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be \\nsubject to $166 million to $986 million in damages. In September 2022, the district court granted summary judgment, holding \\nthat the patents are invalid. In October 2022, Broadband iTV filed a notice of appeal.

The decision imposes a fine of €746 million and corresponding practice revisions. We believe the CNPD’s decision \\nto be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.\\nIn December 2021, the Italian Competition Authority (the “ICA”) issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.à \\nr.l., Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l., Amazon EU S.à r.l., Amazon Italia Services S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming \\nthat certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy infringe EU competition rules.

The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief and, \\nin some cases, unspecified money damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and declaratory relief. These \\nmatters are at various procedural stages, with preliminary and final injunctions issued in certain instances.

In our opinion, Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all \\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. \\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated \\nstatements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the \\nperiod ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 6, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion \\nthereon. \\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its \\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report \\non Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control \\nover financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be \\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and \\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was \\nmaintained in all material respects. \\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a \\nmaterial weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed \\nrisk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides \\na reasonable basis for our opinion. \\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures \\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit \\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSeattle, Washington \\nFebruary 6, 2025\\n71'),\n",

The lead director presides over the\\nexecutive sessions of the independent directors, chairs Board meetings in the Chair’s absence, works with management and\\nthe independent directors to approve agendas, schedules, information, and materials for Board meetings, and is available\\nto engage directly with major shareholders where appropriate.

In assessing directors’ independence, the Board took into account certain transactions,\\nrelationships, and arrangements involving some of the directors and concluded that such transactions, relationships, and\\narrangements did not impair the independence of the director. For Ms. Stonesifer, the Board considered payments in the last\\nthree years in the ordinary course of business from Amazon to entities that publish The Washington Post, including during\\nthe period when Ms. Stonesifer served as interim Chief Executive Officer. For Mr. Weeks, the Board considered payments in the\\npast three years in the ordinary course of business from the Company to Corning Incorporated or its affiliates. All such\\npayments were not significant for any of these companies. In October 2023, IronNet, where Gen.

Key highlights from our website and our sustainability report include:\\n• The Climate Pledge and Carbon-Free Energy.In 2019, we co-founded The Climate Pledge, a goal to reach net-zero\\ncarbon emissions across our operations by 2040, a decade ahead of the Paris Agreement’s goal of 2050. We are proud that\\nmore than 550 companies across more than 55 industries and more than 45 countries have joined The Climate Pledge.\\nAs part of this commitment, we publish our carbon footprint and calculation methodology. In 2023, our absolute carbon\\nemissions decreased by 3%, driven by an 11% reduction in emissions from electricity and a 5% decrease in indirect\\nand supply chain emissions. Our carbon intensity decreased for the fifth consecutive year, down 13% from 2022 to 2023.\\nAmazon also launched The Climate Pledge Fund in 2020 to support the advancement of sustainable technologies and\\nservices. This dedicated investment program—with an initial $2 billion in funding—specifically targets hard-to-abate sectors\\nfor investment, with the goal of supporting companies building breakthrough solutions that could eventually lower the\\noverall cost to decarbonize Amazon and the broader industry. In addition, we established the Right Now Climate Fund, a\\n$100 million fund to remove or avoid carbon emissions by restoring and conserving forests, wetlands, and grasslands\\naround the world. In 2023, 100% of the electricity consumed by our global operations was matched with renewable energy\\nsources—seven years ahead of our original 2030 goal.

We are also decarbonizing our transportation\\nnetwork by deploying zero-emission vehicles, using low-carbon fuels, investing in emerging technologies, and collaborating\\nwith others to accelerate cross-sector innovation. We plan to deploy 100,000 electric delivery vans by 2030, with more\\nthan 20,000 on the road now.\\n• Circular Economy and Avoiding and Managing Waste.We are working to send less material to landfills and more\\nback into the circular economy. Amazon is minimizing waste, including food waste and plastics, increasing recycling, and\\nproviding options for our customers to keep items in use longer through repair, refurbishment, resale as pre-owned, or\\nrecycling. We created our Ships in Product Packaging program to test and certify products that can ship safely in just their\\noriginal manufacturers’ packaging—without an additional Amazon box, envelope, or bag. Since 2015, we have reduced\\nthe average per-shipment packaging weight by 43% and avoided more than 3 million metric tons of packaging material.\\nWe are improving the design and materials used for our packaging, reducing weight, using machine learning algorithms\\nand AI models to identify optimal packaging type and size, and improving the composition of our plastic packaging to use\\nless material and incorporate more recycled content. We have continued to take steps to reduce single-use plastics in\\nour outbound packaging, and as of October 2024, we have removed all plastic air pillows from our delivery packaging used\\nat our global fulfillment centers. Since 2021, we have disclosed the total metric tons of single-use plastic used across\\nour global operations network to ship orders to customers and our reduction of average plastic packaging weight per\\nshipment. We are also giving customers access to products that are more sustainable, including both Amazon-branded\\nproducts and third-party items we offer that feature sustainability certifications through our Climate Pledge Friendly\\nprogram.\\n• Water and Other Natural Resources.We strive to use natural resources in a responsible way across our business and\\nsupply chain, while investing in conservation and restoration initiatives. For example, AWS has set a goal of being water\\npositive by 2030—returning more water to communities than it uses in direct operations. We aim to achieve this by\\nimproving water use effectiveness, using more sustainable sources such as recycled water and harvested rainwater, reusing\\ncooling water in communities, and delivering water replenishment. At the end of 2023, AWS was more than 40% of the\\nway toward achieving its water positive goal (based on measuring reused water and water from replenishment projects\\nversus total water withdrawal net of water from sustainable sources).\\n• Investing in Our Communities.Amazon supports our communities by providing access to food and basic needs,\\nsupporting disaster relief and response efforts, and investing in access to computer science education, skills, and training.\\nAmazon’s $3.6 billion Housing Equity Fund provides low-rate loans and grants to create and preserve affordable homes\\nfor individuals and families earning moderate to low incomes in our three hometown communities—Washington state’s\\nPuget Sound region; the Arlington, Virginia/National Capital region; and Nashville, Tennessee. The Amazon Housing\\nEquity Fund has had a significant, positive impact on rental affordability in communities Amazon calls home, with over\\n$2.2 billion in loans and grants committed. These commitments have created or preserved over 21,000 affordable homes\\nand supported more than 46,000 residents.\\n• Human Rights.Our commitment and approach to human rights are informed by leading international standards and\\nframeworks developed by the UN and the International Labour Organization (“ILO”). Amazon is committed to respecting\\nand supporting the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the UN Universal Declaration of Human\\nRights, the Core Conventions of the ILO, and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We have\\ncodified our commitment to human rights in our Amazon Global Human Rights Principles. We also publish Supply Chain\\nStandards, which detail the requirements and expectations for our suppliers, their supply chains, and selling partners who\\nlist products in our stores, and which are grounded in principles of inclusivity, continuous improvement, and supply\\nchain accountability. We focus our supply chain efforts on six priority commitment areas: safe and healthy workplaces,\\ngender equity, fair wages, responsible recruitment and freely chosen employment, environmental protection, and access\\nto effective grievance mechanisms. In addition, as we continue to improve and expand our human rights due diligence\\npractices, we leverage human rights assessment methodologies to identify and mitigate human rights risks. These\\nassessments help us understand causes of systemic issues, enhance ongoing engagement with critical stakeholders,\\nimplement the correct risk-based mitigation measures, and refine strategies for ongoing risk management across our\\nsupply chain. For example, in 2023, we conducted a human rights saliency assessment for Amazon Private Brands to better\\nunderstand priority human rights risks across our products and how to best address them.\\n• Human Capital.We support our employees through initiatives focusing on workplace health and safety, investments in\\nbenefits and opportunities, and employee engagement, and we publish information about our innovations in worker safety\\nand key safety metrics. Our goal is to be the safest workplace within the industries in which we operate.

In addition, our average total compensation for front-line employees,\\nincluding the value of elected benefits, is more than $29 per hour. Benefits include health care, a 401(k) plan with a\\nCompany match, flexible work hours, and up to 20 weeks of paid pregnancy/parental leave (six weeks for eligible supporting\\nparents). We are also empowering our employees to build the skills they need to remain competitive, grow their careers,\\nand move into higher-paying roles.

We are\\ncommitted to compensating our employees fairly and equitably and publish details on gender and racial/ethnic group\\npay statistics. When evaluating 2024 compensation, our reported data demonstrates that women globally and in the United\\nStates earned 99.9 cents for every dollar that men earned performing comparable jobs, and racial/ethnic minorities in\\nthe United States earned 99.4 cents for every dollar that white employees earned performing comparable jobs.\\nThese ambitious and impactful goals and initiatives build on Amazon’s long-term commitment to sustainability, as well as\\nour commitment to supporting our employees, partners in our supply chain, and our communities. These are just some\\nexamples of the many sustainability and other environmental, social, and human capital initiatives we have underway, as we\\nseek to constantly invent across the Company. We encourage you to learn more about these initiatives and our progress\\ntowards meeting our goals by reviewing our reports, policies, and commitments, many of which are available at\\nwww.aboutamazon.com/about-us/amazon-reports.\\nShareholder Engagement\\nWe believe that effective corporate governance includes year-round engagement with our shareholders. Our shareholder\\nengagement team includes employees whose full-time, year-round responsibilities include engaging with our investors,\\ncommunicating with management and directly with our Board members to inform them on topics discussed and feedback\\nreceived in the course of their engagement meetings, and coordinating and promoting the effectiveness of direct shareholder\\nengagement meetings that our directors participate in. We meet regularly with our shareholders, including both large and\\nsmall investors, to discuss business strategy, performance, compensation philosophy, corporate governance, and\\nenvironmental and social topics. In a typical year, we will engage with dozens of shareholders, including our largest\\nshareholders, two or more times a year. This outreach is complementary to the hundreds of touchpoints our Investor\\nRelations team has with shareholders each year. We find it beneficial to have ongoing dialogue with our shareholders\\nthroughout the year on a full range of investor priorities (instead of engaging with shareholders only prior to our annual\\nmeeting on issues to be voted on in the proxy statement). Depending on the circumstance, our lead director or another\\nindependent director engage in these conversations with shareholders as well.\\nSince the beginning of 2024, we have engaged with 70 of our 100 largest unaffiliated shareholders, as well as with\\nnumerous other shareholders. Our lead independent director, the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance\\nCommittee, or the Chair of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee participated in meetings with\\nshareholders owning more than 25% of our stock, including one-on-one or small group meetings with most of our 20\\nlargest shareholders. In addition, the Board and Board committees receive a number of letters from investors, and our directors\\nreview our responses to such correspondence and provide direction as necessary. Our direct engagement with shareholders\\nhelps us better understand our shareholders’ priorities, perspectives, and areas of concern, while giving us an opportunity\\nto elaborate on our many initiatives and practices and to address the extent to which various aspects of these matters are (or\\nare not) significant given the scope and nature of our operations and our existing practices. We take insights from this\\nfeedback into consideration and regularly share them with our Board as we review and evolve our practices and disclosures.\\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS INFORMATION\\n20'),\n",

At the discretion of the Board, directors are eligible to receive\\nstock-based awards under the 1997 Plan. Similar to compensation for our employees, the compensation for our Board\\nmembers is aligned with long-term value creation because it consists solely of restricted stock unit awards that have three-\\nyear vesting periods. Likewise, because our compensation program is designed to promote long-term performance and\\noperate over a period of years, directors typically do not receive stock-based awards every year, and instead have in the past\\nreceived awards only once every three years. Our Board members’ compensation will be negatively impacted if our stock\\nprice declines and will be favorably impacted if the stock performs beyond the initial stock price at grant date. By not accepting\\ncash compensation, only restricted stock unit awards, the Board sets a tone at the top that compensation should be based\\non long-term value creation.\\n2024 Stock Awards\\nBased on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee’s recommendation, the Board approved restricted stock\\nunit awards for: (1) 5,952 shares to Dr. Ng on April 12, 2024, vesting in three equal annual installments on May 15, 2025,\\nMay 15, 2026, and May 15, 2027; (2) 6,126 shares to Ms. Cooper on September 11, 2024, vesting in three equal annual\\ninstallments on November 15, 2025, November 15, 2026, and November 15, 2027; and (3) 5,448 shares to Mr. Weeks on\\nNovember 20, 2024, vesting in three equal annual installments on February 15, 2026, February 15, 2027, and February 15,\\n2028. The awards were designed to provide approximately $355,000 in compensation annually, in each case based on an\\nassumed value of the restricted stock units vesting in each year, which compensation represents the 50th percentile for annual\\ndirector compensation among a group of peer companies. When determining the amount and vesting schedule for\\ndirectors’ restricted stock unit awards, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Board have not varied\\nawards based on specific committee service.\\nEach grant compensates for future performance, and no portion of a restricted stock unit award vests until the year after it\\nis granted. If a director leaves the Board prior to a vest date for any reason, he or she will forfeit all or any portion of the\\nrestricted stock unit award that has not previously vested.\\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS INFORMATION\\n24'),\n",

We have engaged directly with most\\nshareholder proponents, before and/or after they have submitted a proposal, and carefully evaluate each proposal to assess\\nthe extent to which we already address the requested action. We also assess whether a proposal could be implemented in\\nalignment with our existing principles, goals, and priorities, would be in the best interests of the Company as we weigh risks\\nand opportunities, and would generate long-term shareholder value. When a proposal aligns with and supports these\\nconsiderations, we may implement that proposal, although we may do so in a manner that is different than recommended\\nin the proposal. Moreover, when a proposal is anticipated to receive or actually receives a significant level of support, we seek\\nfeedback on the topic as part of our year-round engagement with our shareholders.\\nFor each shareholder proposal that we receive, we craft thorough and detailed responses and engage with numerous\\ninternal and external stakeholders to share our views and receive their feedback. Most of these proposals request that we\\nprepare a report, adopt a policy, undertake a review, or take some other particular action. In many cases, we already support\\nthe initiatives and have addressed the concerns raised in such proposals. However, we often oppose these proposals,\\nespecially the many proposals that largely repeat prior years’ proposals, as they do not take into account the actions we\\nalready are taking or have taken that we believe resolve or mitigate the underlying concerns of a proposal, the decisions we\\nhave made in prioritizing our initiatives, or the unique and evolving nature of our operations. And in the vast majority of\\ncases, we believe the costs of implementing the proposals significantly outweigh the benefits or the potential impact of\\nspeculative risks or concerns posited in the proposals, andthat the proposals do not enhance or create shareholder value.W e\\nalso may disagree with how a proposal seeks to dictate prescriptive or unrealistic detail in how we approach or report on\\nthe issue.\\nWe also receive proposals from a subset of shareholders who appear to have objectives that are not aligned with investors’\\nand fiduciaries’ goal of enhancing the economic value of their investments, such as seeking publicity or fundraising for a\\nparticular issue or campaign, or for themselves or their organizations. These proposals, and proxy advisory firm commentary\\non them, often contain or repeat inaccurate or biased assertions regarding our operations, even when such inaccuracies or\\nbiases are highlighted to them, fail to evaluate or weigh the costs of implementation relative to the claimed benefits or risks\\nthat they address, or fail to acknowledge steps we have taken to address their issue. Some of these proposals are submitted\\nyear after year with little or no variance, or are revised slightly to avoid acknowledging actions we have taken that address\\nthe underlying concerns. Other proposals highlight a specific societal concern but may have little or nothing to do with our\\nbusiness or operations. We believe that the vast amount of time and financial resources that our Board, management,\\nand business teams spend deliberating and addressing these proposals could be better spent focused on building our business,\\nstrengthening the existing and new initiatives we have underway, and creating long-term shareholder value.\\nItems 4 through 11 are the shareholder proposals that will be voted on at the Annual Meeting if properly presented by or\\non behalf of the shareholder proponent.

And at companies\\nthat separate the roles, this strong counterbalancing structure allows the Board to focus on corporate governance and\\noversight and the CEO to focus on the company’s business.\\nThe issue Amazon shareholders face is that the company hasn’t codified this separation into a policy, giving the\\nBoard the ability to freely combine the roles at any time, for any reason.\\nIn fact, opposing a 2021 shareholder proposal regarding its leadership structure, Amazon’s Board expressed its desire to\\nretain “flexibility to establish the leadership structure that it determines best supports its operations and the Company at a\\nparticular time.”\\nWe certainly recognize and appreciate the need for flexibility but believe it must be framed by sound governance\\nstructure and practice. And codifying the separation of the CEO and Chair into policy would provide exactly that\\nframework, demonstrating a strong, enduring commitment to shareholder interests and stable corporate\\ngovernance.\\nWith the positions currently separated, now would be an opportune time to do so. After all, an ounce of prevention is worth\\na pound of cure. And in an era of heightened scrutiny on corporate governance, this would reinforce Amazon’s dedication\\nto shareholders and long-term value creation.\\nBy adopting this policy, Amazon can continue its legacy of innovation and leadership while eliminating the risk that the\\nChair and CEO roles become combined.

In contrast, the prescriptive approach set forth in this proposal, if implemented, would simply limit the Board’s ability in\\nthe future to tailor our leadership structure to align with the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, without\\nregard to whatever circumstances exist at the time. In addition, in considering this proposal, the Board considered the fact\\nthat peer benchmarking data indicates the proposal’s requested policy is not common practice.\\nAs the proposal notes, the roles of CEO and Chair of the Board are currently separate. However, since Amazon’s founding in\\n1994, the Board has implemented a variety of different leadership structures depending on what the Board determined\\nappropriate at the time. Initially, Jeff Bezos served as Chair of the Board, but not CEO. From 1996 until Mr. Bezos stepped\\ndown as CEO in 2021, Mr. Bezos served as both CEO and Chair of the Board. In 2021, after careful consideration of the Board’s\\nleadership structure and functions, the Board determined it to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders\\nto separate the roles of CEO and Chair of the Board, and for Mr. Bezos to serve as Executive Chair of the Board. In addition,\\nsince 2010, the independent directors on the Board have appointed a lead independent director, who is empowered to play\\nan important role in the Board’s leadership. In light of our success through these various leadership structures, the Board\\nbelieves that shareholders are better served by the Board retaining the ability to adapt to our evolving needs and implement\\nthe optimal leadership structure at any given time.\\nOur Governance Guidelines and Processes Reinforce Our Directors’ Fiduciary Duty under Delaware Law to Act in the Best\\nInterests of the Company and Its Shareholders, Including When Making Decisions Regarding Board Leadership\\nThe proposal objects to the Board’s ability to “freely combine the roles [of CEO and Chair] at any time, for any reason.”\\nHowever, under Delaware corporate law, our Board must act in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders,\\nincluding when making decisions regarding board leadership. Therefore, concerns about the Board carelessly changing our\\nleadership structure without sufficient reasons are unfounded. Instead, consistent with our directors’ fiduciary duty to routinely\\nevaluate and determine the most appropriate leadership structure for Amazon and our shareholders, our governance\\nguidelines and processes authorize the Board to determine on a case-by-case basis the most effective leadership structure\\nfor the Company. This approach acknowledges that the Board is best positioned to evaluate and establish the leadership\\nstructure that will allow it to operate most effectively in light of the composition of the Board, the strengths and demands\\nupon our leadership team, and the strategic goals, opportunities, and challenges facing the Company.\\nImplementing the proposal would not change our leadership structure or further enhance the independent oversight the\\nBoard already exercises. Our current leadership structure, which has the support of all of the independent directors on the\\nBoard, consists of an Executive Chair, who as the proposal notes is not also the CEO, and a lead independent director, who is\\nelected by the independent directors.

It should be advertising in ways that support its\\ncompetitive interests and build its reputation for serving its diverse customers.\\nBut recent reports have shown that Amazon colluded1 with the world’s largest advertising buyers, agencies, industry\\nassociations, and social media platforms through the Global Alliance for Responsible Media1 to demonetize platforms,\\npodcasts, news outlets, and others for expressing disfavored political and religious viewpoints.\\nA product of the World Federation of Advertisers, GARM was formed in 2019 and quickly amassed tremendous market\\npower. WFA members represent about 90% of global advertising, spending nearly a trillion dollars annually.2\\nGARM’s express mission was to “do more to address harmful and misleading media environments,” specifically “hate\\nspeech, bullying and disinformation,” all under the guise of “brand safety.”3 GARM leader Rob Rakowitz explained that the\\n“whole issue bubbling beneath the surface” of the advertising industry and digital platforms is the “extreme global\\ninterpretation of the US Constitution.”4\\nGARM graded platforms on how much they censored using the above terms as well as terms like “insensitive” or “irresponsible”\\ntreatment of “debated sensitive social issues.”5 The 2024 Viewpoint Diversity Business Index6 found that 76% of the\\nlargest tech and finance companies have similarly vague and subjective terms. These terms encourage companies—and\\nactivists like GARM—to restrict service for arbitrary and discriminatory reasons and let them avoid accountability by hiding\\ncensorship behind vague and shifting standards.\\nFor its part, GARM promoted hyper-partisan and censorial groups like the Global Disinformation Index and NewsGuard,\\nwhich smear many mainstream outlets as “disinformation.”7 GARM threatened Spotify because Joe Rogan promoted views\\nit disagreed with on COVID-19. And it infamously boycotted X because Elon Musk loosened some of the platform’s censorship\\nrestrictions.8\\n1 See Guidelines on Significant Corporate Governance Issues, available at\\nhttps://ir.aboutamazon.com/corporate-governance/documents-and-charters/guidelines-on-significant-corporate-governance-issues/default.aspx.\\nSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\\n2025 Proxy Statement 35'),\n",

It discloses product-related value chain GHG emissions only for its private label (i.e.,\\nAmazon-branded) products.5 However, Amazon states that “private brands sales represent only about 1% of our total sales.”6\\nAmazon therefore fails to disclose material emissions associated with 99% of the products sold on its retail platform.\\nUnder the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, retail companies should count the emissions associated with all relevant products sold\\nacross the Company’s product portfolio.7 Peers Target and Walmart each disclose emissions from all product sales, not\\njust their private label products.8 Disclosing the GHG emissions associated with only a fraction of a retailer’s product sales,\\nas Amazon does, risks providing a misleading impression of the retailer’s total emissions and its exposure to climate-related\\nrisk.\\nBy expanding disclosures to cover emissions from all of Amazon’s retail products – defined by the Company’s most recent\\n10-K as sales for which Amazon is the seller of record – the Company can mitigate risk across its product portfolio and\\ndemonstrate that its actions are responsive to climate regulations approved by California and the European Union. Increased\\nemissions disclosures will prepare Amazon for growing mandatory reporting requirements and carbon pricing via carbon\\nborder adjustment mechanisms.

Data center\\npower demand may more than double, from 1-2% of global power now to 3-4% by 2030 (though some analysis suggests\\na range of possible scenarios).3\\nAmazon has made high-profile climate commitments central to its corporate strategy. With its Climate Pledge, the company\\nhas committed to “net-zero carbon emissions by 2040” and “matching” 100% of the electricity it uses “with renewable\\nenergy by 2030”.4 Among the aims of the Pledge is “good jobs in green industries.”5\\nA number of factors raise concerns about Amazon’s ability to meet its climate commitments while expanding data centers\\nfor artificial intelligence. Can it achieve net-zero emissions by 2040? Amazon announced it has matched 100% of electricity\\nused in 2023 with renewable energy; can it maintain this in future years given data center expansion plans?6\\nUtilities in a number of geographies are planning expansion of fossil power, or pushing back retirement dates, to meet data\\ncenter demand. For example, Virginia has the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and Amazon Web Services\\n“call[s] Virginia home”7. Utilities in the state are planning buildout of new gas plants to meet demand from data center\\ngrowth. Utilities elsewhere are also keeping coal online to meet demand.8\\nAs a central part of meeting energy demand going forward, Amazon has announced it will invest in small modular nuclear\\nreactors – but these will not deliver power until the early 2030s, so they can not help meet Amazon’s growing power demands\\nfor the remainder of this decade.9\\nTo meet its climate commitments, Amazon relies on renewable energy credits or certificates (RECs).10 But this approach\\nfaces new questions in the context of rapidly rising energy demand. For example, will the quantity of RECs purchased increase,\\nand will a sufficient amount be available going forward? How will time and location of use change, and does growing\\ndemand impact additionality?\\nSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\\n40'),\n",

We also reached our goal to match 100% of the electricity consumed by our global operations (including\\nour data centers) with renewable energy in 2023, seven years ahead of the original target of 2030.14\\nWe have more than 600 renewable energy projects all around the world, and the majority of the utility-scale projects we\\ninvest in connect to grids where we have operations, including our data center regions. Additionally, we have been the world’s\\nlargest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for five years running.15\\nWe Have Made Great Progress and Are Continuing to Work at Increasing the Energy Efficiency of Our Data Centers\\nAWS is committed to innovating in every area of our global infrastructure to help increase efficiency and minimize\\nenvironmental impact. We reached a global power usage effectiveness (“PUE”) rating for our data centers of 1.15 in 2023,\\nwith the best-performing site registering a PUE rating of 1.04 (a lower PUE indicates a more efficient data center, and a PUE\\nscore of 1.0 is perfect).16\\nWe are focused on optimizing the performance and energy efficiency associated with running complex AI workloads. To\\noptimize performance and energy consumption when running complex AI workloads like large language models, AWS has\\ndeveloped purpose-built silicon like the AWS Trainium chip and AWS Inferentia chip. These are designed to achieve significantly\\nhigher throughput than comparable accelerated compute instances, enabling AWS to more efficiently execute AI models\\nat scale while reducing the carbon footprint for similar workloads and enhancing performance per watt of power\\nconsumption.17 In December 2024, we announced new data center components that are designed to support the next\\ngeneration of AI innovation and customers’ evolving needs while creating data centers that are more energy efficient. These\\ncomponents will enable AWS to deliver 12% more compute power per site for customer workloads and will reduce the\\noverall number of data centers needed to deliver the same amount of compute capacity.18 The components include more\\nefficient cooling systems that are expected to reduce mechanical energy consumption by up to 46% compared to the previous\\ndesign during peak cooling conditions, without increasing water usage on a per-megawatt basis.19\\nAs AWS builds new data centers, we seek the optimal balance between energy and water use. AWS is increasing the use of free-\\nair cooling systems that cool servers with outside air, which can help avoid the need for energy-intensive compressor-\\nbased cooling systems throughout much of the year.20 Even during peak summer temperatures, our data centers can utilize\\ndirect evaporative cooling, which uses water to cool the air and remove heat from servers, and AWS uses real-time data to\\nadapt to weather conditions.21 Balancing our water and energy efficiency practices is one of the reasons why AWS, at the end\\nof 2023, was more than 40% of the way toward meeting its goal of being water positive by 2030, returning more water\\nto communities than it uses in its direct operations.22 Furthermore, in 2023, 100% of the electricity consumed by 22 AWS\\ndata center regions was matched with renewable energy sources, up from 19 regions in 2022.23\\nAWS also provides tools and guidance to its customers to enable them to promote efficiencies through their data management\\nstrategies. This includes keeping active “hot” data separate from inactive “cold” data sets using AWS’s fully managed\\nstorage services and assisting customers with optimizing their data replication processes by reducing replication size and\\nthroughput requirements, resulting in decreased energy consumption and carbon emissions.24\\nWe Are Working to Reduce Carbon Emissions from Our Data Centers\\nIn addition to increasing our energy efficiency, we are working to reduce the carbon emissions from our data centers. Our\\nefforts include diversifying our energy portfolio with additional reliable carbon-free sources of energy, like nuclear power. In\\n2024, we also announced three new agreements to support the development of nuclear energy projects, including enabling\\nthe construction of several new small modular reactors (“SMRs”).

For\\nexample, we have an agreement to co-locate one of our data center facilities next to a nuclear facility in Pennsylvania,\\nwhich will directly power our data centers with carbon-free energy and help to preserve the existing nuclear reactor.26\\nWe are also pursuing the use of renewable diesel fuel. Our new data center components announced in December 2024\\ninclude backup generators that can be powered by renewable diesel fuel, which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by\\nup to 90% over the fuel’s lifecycle when compared to fossil diesel fuel.27\\nAnother way we are reducing carbon emissions in our data centers is by decreasing the embodied carbon associated with\\nour infrastructure. In 2023, AWS built 36 data centers with lower-carbon concrete, an increase from 16 in 2022, and in 2024,\\nAWS updated its design standards to require the use of concrete with 35% less embodied carbon than the industry\\naverage in new data centers around the world.28 In addition to using lower-carbon concrete, AWS has begun incorporating\\nhigher-strength structural steel into its data center structural designs, which has reduced steel content by 70 tons for each two-\\nstory data center and 137 tons for each three-story data center, and decreased emissions by 63 and 124 metric tons of\\ncarbon dioxide equivalent, respectively.29 In 2023, AWS built 31 data centers with lower-carbon steel, an increase from 10\\nin 2022.30 Using lower-carbon steel and concrete allowed AWS to avoid over 46,700 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\\nin 2023.31 We are also investing in lower-carbon concrete and steel technologies through the Climate Pledge Fund, which\\nis a $2 billion venture investment program supporting the development of more sustainable technologies and services to\\nenable us to meet our net-zero carbon goal.32\\nFinally, we aim to minimize waste from our data centers by enhancing our circular economy strategy.

Our re:Cycle Reverse Logistics hubs help recover our data center hardware and\\nextend its life. As of December 2024, more than 99% of all AWS securely decommissioned racks that were sent to these\\nhubs were diverted from landfills and have been reused by AWS, sold into the secondary market for reuse, or recycled.

According to the United Nations’ High Commissioner for Human Rights:\\nAI has the potential to strengthen authoritarian governance. It can operate lethal autonomous weapons. It can form the\\nbasis for more powerful tools of societal control, surveillance, and censorship. Facial recognition systems, for example, can\\nturn into mass surveillance of our public spaces, destroying any concept of privacy. AI systems that are used in the\\ncriminal justice system to predict future criminal behaviour have already been shown to reinforce discrimination and to\\nundermine rights, including the presumption of innocence.2\\nFor example, the use of AI to make human resource decisions may lead to unlawful employment discrimination. In 2018,\\nour Company reportedly scrapped an experimental AI hiring tool that had taught itself that male candidates were preferable\\nto female candidates.3 Military and police applications of AI technology can also raise human rights concerns. In 2021, our\\nCompany reportedly took over a Department of Defense contract for an AI system to analyze military drone footage after\\nGoogle dropped the project due to protests by Google employees.4\\nWhile we appreciate the steps that our Company has taken to establish ethical guidelines for the responsible use of AI, we\\nbelieve that an independent, third-party assessment of the Board of Directors oversight of human rights risks associated with\\nAI will provide shareholders with transparency regarding the Company’s corporate governance procedures related to AI\\nand may provide additional recommendations to strengthen the Company’s responsible AI policies.\\nFor these reasons, we urge you to vote FOR this proposal.\\n1 United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, “Taxonomy of Human Rights Risks Connected to Generative AI,” November 2, 2023,\\nhttps://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/issues/business/b-tech/taxonomy-GenAI-Human-Rights-Harms.pdf; U.S. Departmentof State, “Risk\\nManagement Profile for Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights,” July 25, 2024, https://www.state.gov/risk-management-profile-for-ai-and-human-\\nrights/.\\n2 United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, “Artificial intelligence Must Be Grounded In Human Rights, Says High Commissioner,”\\nJuly 12, 2023, https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2023/07/artificial-intelligence-must-be-grounded-human-rights-says-high-commissioner.\\n3 Reuters, “Insight - Amazon Scraps Secret AI Recruiting Tool That Showed Bias Against Women,” October 11, 2018, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-\\namazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G/.\\n4 Data Center Dynamics, “Amazon and Microsoft picked up $50m in US military drone surveillance contracts, following Google dropping Project Maven,”\\nSeptember 8, 2021, https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/amazon-and-microsoft-picked-up-50m-in-us-military-drone-surveillance-\\ncontracts-following-google-dropping-project-maven/.\\nEnd of Shareholder Proposal and Statement of Support\\nShareholder: AFL-CIO Equity Index Funds, represented by Segal Marco Advisors\\nSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\\n44'),\n",

For\\nexample, our commitment to responsible AI has eight core dimensions that include privacy and security, safety,\\nfairness, and transparency.\\n• We also believe collaboration among companies, governments, researchers, and the AI community is critical to foster\\nthe development of AI that is safe, responsible, and trustworthy. To that end, we have closely collaborated with\\nefforts such as the G7 AI Hiroshima Process Code of Conduct and the AI Safety Summits in the UK and Seoul, and in\\nMay 2024, we joined the Frontier Model Forum to help advance AI safety.\\n• Our Board has the proper composition to effectively oversee human rights risks associated with AI and, together with\\nthe Board committees, already provides active, informed, and appropriate oversight of human rights and other risks\\nassociated with AI.\\n• Shareholders already have spoken on this topic as the focus of this proposal—Board oversight of AI-associated\\nrisks—is substantially the same as the proposal submitted last year by this proponent, which received less than 10%\\nsupport. Just as last year’s proposal requesting a separate Board committee to oversee risks solely relating to AI\\ntechnology was redundant and inefficient, we believe that commissioning a third-party report on oversight of these\\nrisks requested by this year’s proposal would not be a prudent use of our resources or provide meaningful information\\nto our shareholders and is unnecessary in light of our Board’s active engagement and experience with these topics.\\nWe Are Committed to, and Are a Leader in, the Responsible Development and Use of AI\\nOur commitment to the responsible development and use of AI is backed by our actions. We have announced new tools,\\npartnerships, scientific research, and testing to improve the safety, security, and transparency of our AI services and models34\\nand have described ways we are transforming responsible AI from theory into practice and promoting the safe and\\nresponsible development of AI as a force for good.35 Our work implementing responsible AI has continued to evolve as\\ntechnology moves forward, and we remain dedicated to making our customers’ lives better while also establishing and\\nimplementing appropriate safeguards.\\nIn addition, our commitment to responsible AI has eight core dimensions: (i) privacy and security (i.e., data and models\\nshould be appropriately obtained, used, and protected); (ii) safety (i.e., misuse and harmful system outputs should be deterred);\\n(iii) fairness (i.e., results should be of consistent quality across different groups of stakeholders); (iv) veracity and robustness\\n(i.e., the system should produce the correct outputs, even when it encounters unexpected or adversarial inputs);\\n(v) explainability (i.e., system outputs should be explainable and understandable); (vi) controllability (i.e., the system should\\ninclude mechanisms for monitoring and steering its behavior); (vii) governance (i.e., best practices should be incorporated into\\nthe AI supply chain, which includes both providers and deployers); and (viii) transparency (i.e., stakeholders should be able\\nto make informed choices about their engagement with the AI system).36 For example, these dimensions inform design\\nobjectives that guide our decision-making during model development and help to align our human values in this space as\\nwe build our services, engage with customers, and drive innovation.\\nOur AWS Responsible AI Policy explicitly prohibits the use of AWS AI services, features, and functionality: (1) for intentional\\ndisinformation or deception; (2) to violate the privacy rights of others, including unlawful tracking, monitoring, and\\nidentification; (3) to depict a person’s voice or likeness without their consent or other appropriate rights, including unauthorized\\nimpersonation and non-consensual sexual imagery; (4) for harm or abuse of a minor, including grooming and child sexual\\nexploitation; (5) to harass, harm, or encourage the harm of individuals or specific groups; (6) to intentionally circumvent safety\\nfilters and functionality or prompt models to act in a manner that violates our policies; or (7) to perform a lethal function\\n34 See https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/a-progress-update-on-our-commitment-to-safe-responsible-generative-ai/.\\n35 See https://aws.amazon.com/ai/responsible-ai/.\\n36 See https://www.amazon.science/blog/amazon-nova-and-our-commitment-to-responsible-ai.\\nSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\\n2025 Proxy Statement 45'),\n",

For\\nexample, in April 2024, we announced the general availability of Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock and Model Evaluation in\\nAmazon Bedrock to make it easier to introduce safeguards, prevent harmful content, and evaluate models against key safety\\nand accuracy criteria.38 In July 2024, we launched contextual grounding check in Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock, which\\nenables customers to detect hallucinations in model responses that are not grounded in enterprise data or are irrelevant to\\nthe users’ queries.39 Also in July, we announced an application programming interface (“API”) for Guardrails for Amazon\\nBedrock, which is designed to allow customers to apply standardized and consistent safeguards for all of their generative AI\\napplications built using any self-managed (custom) or third-party foundation models, regardless of the underlying\\ninfrastructure. To help reduce the spread of disinformation, all images generated by Amazon Titan Image Generator contain\\nan invisible watermark by default. Titan Image Generator is designed to be tamper-resistant, helping increase transparency\\naround AI-generated content and reduce the spread of disinformation. We also introduced a new API preview in Amazon\\nBedrock that checks for the existence of this watermark and helps confirm whether an image was generated by Titan Image\\nGenerator.40 Further, in December 2024, we introduced Amazon Nova, a new family of foundation models built using\\nreinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning to align model behavior, as well as integrated safety measures and\\nprotections like guardrail models and image watermarking.41 We also provide resources such as AWS AI Service Cards, a\\nform of transparency documentation that helps AWS customers understand AWS’ AI and machine learning services’ limitations\\nand responsible AI best practices, so they can build their AI applications more safely and evaluate models against key\\nsafety and accuracy criteria.42\\nWe also believe collaboration among companies, governments, researchers, and the AI community is critical to foster the\\ndevelopment of AI that is safe, responsible, and trustworthy. To date, we have published or funded more than 500 research\\npapers, studies, and scientific blogs on responsible AI.43 We closely collaborated with efforts such as the publication of a\\nroadmap for AI policy from U.S. senators, the G7 AI Hiroshima Process Code of Conduct, and the AI Safety Summits in the\\nUK and Seoul, and we committed to these important standards and frameworks that advance innovation and safety. In\\nFebruary 2024, Amazon joined the U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute Consortium, established by the National Institute\\nof Standards and Technology (“NIST”), and in May 2024, we joined the Frontier Model Forum to help advance AI safety.44\\nAmazon is collaborating with NIST to establish a new measurement science to enable the identification of scalable,\\ninteroperable measurements and methodologies to promote development of trustworthy AI.45 Additionally, in\\nNovember 2024, AWS became the first major cloud service provider to announce ISO/IEC 42001 accredited certification for\\nAI services, covering Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Q Business, Amazon Textract, and Amazon Transcribe. ISO/IEC 42001 is an\\ninternational management system standard that outlines requirements and controls for organizations to promote the\\nresponsible development of AI systems.46\\nFinally, as we navigate the transformative potential of these technologies, we believe that education is the foundation for\\nrealizing their benefits while mitigating risks. Amazon employees have spent tens of thousands of training hours since\\nJuly 2023, covering a range of critical topics like risk assessments, as well as deep dives into complex considerations\\nsurrounding fairness, privacy, and model explainability.

Corporations could face an annual financial risk of\\napproximately $100 billion should governments require them to cover the waste management costs of packaging they\\nproduce.2 Governments around the world are increasingly enacting such policies, including five new state laws that impose\\nfees on corporations for single-use plastic (SUP) packaging.3 The European Union has banned ten SUP pollutants and taxed\\nsome non-recycled plastic packaging.4 A French law requires 10% of packaging be reusable by 2027 and Portugal requires\\n30% reusable packaging by 2030.5 Additionally, consumer demand for sustainable packaging is increasing.6\\nPew Charitable Trusts’ groundbreaking study,Breaking the Plastic Wave(“Pew Report”), concluded that improved recycling\\nalone is insufficient to address plastic pollution—instead, recycling must be coupled with reductions in use, materials redesign,\\nand substitution.7 The Pew Report finds that the greatest opportunity to reduce or eliminate plastic lies with flexible\\nplastic packaging, often used for chips, sweets, and condiments among other uses, and virtually unrecyclable in America.\\nWith innovation, redesign, and substitution, 26 million metric tons of flexibles can be avoided globally.8\\nThe Company markets more than 100 brands of consumer goods, food, and beverages, many of which are packaged in\\nflexible plastic. Its Whole Foods subsidiary and Happy Belly brand sell numerous goods in flexible multi-layer packaging that\\ncannot be routinely recycled. The Company is also notably absent from participation in the largest pre-competitive corporate\\ninitiative to address plastic pollution, the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment. Competitors, including Walmart and\\nTarget, have adopted goals to make plastic packaging recyclable, reusable, or compostable by 2025, while Amazon has\\nnot.\\nOur Company could avoid regulatory, environmental, and competitive risks by adopting a comprehensive approach to\\naddressing flexible plastic packaging use at scale.\\nRESOLVED: Shareholders request that the Board issue a report, at reasonable expense and excluding proprietary information,\\ndescribing how Amazon could address flexible plastic packaging in alignment with the findings of the Pew Report, or other\\nauthoritative sources, to reduce its contribution to plastic pollution.\\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT:The report should, at Board discretion:\\n• Assess the reputational, financial, and operational risks associated with continuing to use non-recyclable plastic packaging\\nwhile plastic pollution grows;\\n• Evaluate actions to achieve fully recyclable packaging including elimination and accelerated research into innovative\\nreusable substitution; and\\n• Describe opportunities to pre-competitively work with peers to research and develop reusable packaging as an alternative\\nto single-use packaging.\\n1 https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2020/10/breakingtheplasticwave_mainreport.pdf, p.4\\n2 https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2020/10/breakingtheplasticwave_mainreport.pdf, p.9\\n3 https://www.packworld.com/sustainable-packaging/recycling/article/22922253/ameripen-shares-key-lessons-from-early-epr-adopters\\n4 https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/plastics/single-use-plastics_en\\nSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\\n48'),\n",

Our average plastic\\npackaging weight per shipment decreased by 9% in 2023 across our global operations network, building on the over\\n17% reduction achieved in 2022. Since 2020, we have avoided the use of 80,500 metric tons of plastic packaging\\nglobally. In addition, in December 2023, two-thirds of our shipments in North America included Amazon-added plastic\\ndelivery packaging and, by December 2024, we reduced this to one-third.\\n• As of October 2024, we removed all plastic air pillows from our delivery packaging used at our global fulfillment\\ncenters, our biggest reduction in plastic packaging in North America to date. As part of this transition, we were able to\\nquickly expand our use of paper filler made from 100% recycled content across North America. In addition, during\\n2023, we continued to expand recyclable paper padded bag use across the U.S. and Canada, replacing 99.7% of\\nharder-to-recycle padded bags that contain both plastic and paper. We have also retrofitted more than 120 of our\\nautomated packing machines that made plastic bags to now create made-to-fit paper bags across the U.S. We\\nimplemented this in more than 20 fulfillment centers, helping us avoid more than 130 million plastic bags this year.\\nDuring 2022, in Europe, we replaced our single-use plastic outbound packaging with 100% recyclable paper and\\ncardboard packaging in our fulfillment network.\\n• Additionally, we have innovated and invested in technologies, processes, and materials that since 2015 have helped\\nreduce the weight of the packaging per shipment by 43% on average and avoided more than 3 million metric tons of\\npackaging material. In 2023, we shipped 12% of our orders globally without any additional Amazon packaging.\\n• Whole Foods Market is currently working toward making 100% of its own packaging, including private label and\\nin-store food service packaging, reusable, recyclable, or compostable.\\nWe Are Committed to Protecting the Planet and Recognize the Importance of Reducing Plastic Waste\\nWe are committed to protecting the planet and recognize the importance of reducing plastic waste by promoting reusable\\nand recyclable packaging. As described in more detail below, we have made progress in four primary areas in our efforts to\\nreduce our use of plastics: (1) plastics for products we repackage for delivery, (2) plastics in packaging for products\\nmanufactured by other companies that we sell to our customers, (3) plastics in physical stores, primarily our grocery business,\\nand (4) plastics in Amazon devices and our private label products.\\nIn contrast to consumer-packaged goods companies, our greatest impact comes from reducing our use of plastic for\\nproducts repackaged for delivery. To that end, we are rapidly making progress to significantly reduce our use of single-use\\nplastic, including flexible plastic packaging. To measure our progress, we publicly report each year on the amount of single-\\nuse plastic being used across our global operations network to ship orders to customers.52\\nProducts Repackaged for Delivery\\nWe seek to increase recycling rates for Amazon packaging and strive to enable curbside recyclability where available.

For example, as of\\nOctober 2024, we have removed all plastic air pillows from our delivery packaging used at our global fulfillment centers,\\nour biggest reduction in plastic packaging in North America to date. As part of this transition, we were able to quickly expand\\nour use of paper filler made from 100% recycled content across North America.55 In addition, during 2023, we continued\\nto expand recyclable paper padded bag use across the U.S. and Canada, replacing 99.7% of harder-to-recycle padded bags\\nthat contain both plastic and paper. We have also retrofitted more than 120 of our automated packing machines that\\nmade plastic bags to now create made-to-fit paper bags across the U.S. We implemented this in more than 20 fulfillment\\ncenters, helping us avoid more than 130 million plastic bags this year. During 2022, in Europe, we replaced our single-use\\nplastic outbound packaging with 100% recyclable paper and cardboard packaging in our fulfillment network.\\nProducts Manufactured by Other Companies\\nMost of the products we sell are manufactured by other companies. We recognize that we can help manufacturers reduce\\ntheir use of plastics and have partnered with them to scale sustainable packaging development across our supply chain. For\\nexample, our industry leading Ships in Product Packaging (“SIPP”) program financially incentivizes manufacturers to\\npackage their products in easy-to-open, 100% recyclable packaging, including plastics. The SIPP program also allows us to\\nship products in their own containers, eliminating all additional packaging material for these products, including plastics.\\nThrough the SIPP program and related packaging design and testing services, we have helped manufacturers develop more\\nsustainable packaging. We also use machine learning to identify products that can easily qualify for the program and\\nreach out to selling partners to get them certified. In 2023, we shipped 12% of our packages globally without additional\\nAmazon packaging, including 13% of shipments in the U.S. and Canada (up from 12% in 2022) and 9% of shipments in Europe\\n(up from 7% in 2022).56 Initially, the program was primarily offered to vendors, but in February 2024 we expanded the\\nprogram to allow sellers to participate when using Amazon’s fulfillment network in North America and Europe. In 2024, nearly\\n4 million seller products were certified to ship in their own product packaging through seller engagement, machine\\nlearning, and product testing that helps identify qualifying products. We continue to expand this program across the\\nglobe.57\\nOver the last several years, investment in this sort of innovation as well as other technologies, processes, and materials\\nhave helped reduce the weight of our packaging per shipment by 43% on average and avoided more than 3 million metric\\ntons of packaging material since 2015.58 To further incentivize sustainability efforts, we also partner with brands, vendors,\\nand manufacturers through our Climate Pledge Friendly program, which helps customers discover and shop for more-\\nsustainable products. There are currently more than 1,400,000 products available through the Climate Pledge Friendly\\nprogram (up from 550,000 in 2022),59 with every product having one or more of over 50 qualifying sustainability certifications\\nthat help preserve the natural world, including our own Compact by Design, Plant-Based Fiber Blended, and Pre-owned\\nCertified.60\\n53 See Amazon 2023 Sustainability Report at 32; see alsohttps://www.aboutamazon.com/news/sustainability/how-amazon-is-reducing-packaging.

Whole Foods Market’s Packaging Guidelines encourage its suppliers to use more eco-\\nfriendly packaging. The guidelines are grounded in four core concepts aimed at balancing safety, performance, and\\nsustainability: material safety, material performance and efficiency, design for recovery, and responsible sourcing.61 In\\nalignment with Whole Foods Market’s sustainability strategy, these guidelines are intended to reduce the amount of packaging\\nWhole Foods Market uses, improve source material, and design for end-of-life and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The\\nguidelines also aim to optimize material efficiency and performance without sacrificing the ability to maintain the product’s\\nquality and freshness, which is important to deliver customers high quality, fresh products and also to not create food\\nwaste through spoilage. In addition, where bags, film, and pouches are used, guidelines recommend paper-based options\\nwhere possible, following in preference by bioplastic and mono-polyethylene films with recycled content. These alternatives,\\nwhile not curbside recyclable, can be sustainable from a material sourcing and greenhouse gas emissions perspective.\\nWhole Foods Market is currently working toward making 100% of its own packaging, including private label and in-store\\nfood service packaging, reusable, recyclable, or compostable.\\nIn 2008, Whole Foods Market was the first U.S. grocer to ban disposable plastic bags at checkout, instead opting for 100%\\npost-consumer recycled-content and Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”)-certified paper grocery bags, and in 2023 Whole\\nFoods introduced stronger twist handle bags at select Whole Food Market stores that are still 100% post-consumer recycled\\ncontent and FSC-certified. These stronger bags reduce the need for double bagging, dramatically reducing the amount of\\nbags used at checkout. Whole Foods Market also provides customers a wide selection of reusable grocery bags in a variety of\\ncolors and sizes. Whole Foods Market also implemented smaller produce bags at its stores in 2019, a change that significantly\\nreduces the use of plastic annually. In July 2019, Whole Foods Market became the first national retailer to remove all the\\nplastic straws from its cafes and coffee bars, replacing them with FSC-certified paper straws that are recyclable and\\ncompostable. Also, in 2019, Whole Foods Market stores replaced all plastic rotisserie chicken containers with bags that use\\napproximately 70% less plastic.\\nIn addition, in the United States, we rolled out a new curbside recyclable package that keeps grocery items frozen or chilled\\nduring delivery for our Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market customers. The package uses recycled paper, which\\neliminates the need for plastic liners or bubble-bag insulation. The packaging is produced regionally in the United States,\\nenabling us to deliver it to Amazon Fresh grocery hubs, stores, and Whole Foods Market locations with fewer miles traveled\\nacross the supply chain. In North America, we launched daily variable insulation for Whole Foods Market deliveries so that\\ninsulating material requirements are tracked and adjusted daily to ensure they are only used when necessary. This resulted in\\navoiding approximately 1,300 metric tons of packaging in 2023.62 In addition, grocery delivery packaging used by Amazon\\nFresh was 88% recyclable by weight.\\nAmazon Devices and Private Label Products\\nAcross our device product lines, we average 98% wood fiber-based materials in our packaging. In 2023, 90% of our new\\ndevices and accessories launched with packaging that is 100% recyclable in the United States, up from 79% in 2022.63 We\\nare incorporating recycled materials into our devices whenever possible. As of the end of 2023, among Echo, Fire TV, Fire\\ntablet, Kindle, and smart home products, we had various products made from majority- or all-recycled content, including those\\ncontaining 75% recycled plastic, 100% recycled yarn, 100% recycled aluminum, and 90% recycled magnesium.64 In 2024,\\nwe announced that we further redesigned our device packaging for Echo, Kindle, and Fire TV to improve the circularity of our\\npackaging.65 The new packaging introduces, on average, 30% more recycled fiber content, reducing the reliance on virgin\\ntree-based and bleached fibers. We are also working with our suppliers to reduce waste related to the manufacture of our\\ndevices. For example, our devices teams engage suppliers to decrease waste and material use as part of our work to\\nencourage more efficient manufacturing.\\nWe provide various programs and resources through our Amazon Second Chance website66 to equip customers with\\ninformation on how to trade in, recycle, or repair Amazon devices and products, how to recycle Amazon packaging, and\\nhow to shop for like-new and refurbished products.

If that premise were accurate, injuries would increase\\nas productivity and speed increase. In fact, however, our experience over the last five years has been exactly the opposite—we\\nhave increased our delivery speeds, while decreasing the injury rates across our network. Our strong policies—and adherence\\nto them—are helping us create a safer work environment every day, and that is clear in the data. It is also clear to objective\\nobservers like the judge in Washington state in the matter described above who, after six weeks of testimony and evidence,\\nacknowledged our robust safety programs and employees’ engagement on safety in dismissing all claims against Amazon.\\nThe proposal also misleadingly claims that a disproportionate percentage of Amazon warehouse employees’ injuries are\\n“serious” in nature. But that incorrectly conflates “serious” injuries with what is called the “DART” rate, which measures injuries\\nresulting in days away, restricted work, or transferred work. OSHA does not define DART as a measure of “serious” injuries,\\nand we believe that LTIR is a better metric for understanding the frequency of more impactful injuries because that metric\\naccounts for all injuries that actually require time away from work.\\nAlso, in contrast to what this proposal suggests, we do not require employees to meet specific, fixed productivity quotas.\\nInstead, we assess employee performance based on safe and achievable expectations as well as their adherence to safety rules\\nand standard work expectations. We are committed to manageable workloads—we value quality over quantity and our\\nemployees are encouraged to work with intention, not speed.\\nWe Proactively Identify Potential Risks and Address Hazards to Improve Workplace Safety\\nIn addition to measuring our safety performance using the metrics discussed above, we identify and assess leading indicators,\\nwhich are proactive metrics used as early predictors of safety performance. They help safety professionals and operations\\nleaders identify potential risks that might cause incidents or injuries before they occur. By examining leading indicators and\\naddressing potential hazards proactively, we are able to create a safer environment for our employees, partners, and\\ncommunities. Leading indicators at Amazon include data from inspections, assessments, and audits, as well as data from\\nemployee and leader surveys, one-to-one conversations, focus groups, and observations of actual on-site activities provided\\nby our employees.\\nFor example, in 2024, we conducted 7.8 million inspections globally, a 24% increase from the 6.3 million inspections\\nconducted in 2023, and we audited 331 sites across Amazon. As another example, Dragonfly is a tool—available on employees’\\ndevices—that enables employees to easily share safety concerns and suggestions; site managers are informed so they can\\ntake appropriate action. In 2024, over 130,000 employees used Dragonfly to provide suggestions.

To continue reducing MSD injuries, we have devoted considerable resources to\\nimprove ergonomic conditions as part of ongoing investments in safety improvements. Across our operations network, we\\nare retrofitting our sites with adjustable height workstations and carts, and implementing our proprietary, award-winning\\nErgoPick technology to help ensure employees pick packages within their ergonomic power zone—the area between\\nthe shoulder and mid-thigh. We have also increased the use of robotics in our warehouses to handle repetitive tasks and\\nheavy lifting that can lead to MSDs, supporting a safer workplace. Robot systems like Robin and Cardinal help sort, lift, and\\nplace packages.74 They handle repetitive and strenuous tasks so our employees can work more comfortably. Additionally, one\\nof our newest robotics systems, Sequoia, transports inventory directly to employees’ workstations at an ergonomically\\nfriendly height, eliminating the need for them to reach above their heads or squat down. These are just a few examples of\\nthe innovations we have created to provide a safer work environment for our employees so they can focus on more engaging\\ntasks.\\n72 See https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-response-to-senator-bernie-sanders-report-on-workplace-safety.\\n73 See, e.g., 2023 Amazon Sustainability Report at 81, available athttps://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2023-amazon-sustainability-report.pdf; see also\\nhttps://safety.aboutamazon.com.\\n74 See https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazon-fulfillment-center-robotics-ai.\\nSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\\n2025 Proxy Statement 55'),\n",

As a result, we avoid tying compensation to discrete, short-term performance goals, financial or\\notherwise, which could result in our executives focusing on limited and selective short-term objectives at the expense\\nof building long-term shareholder value.\\nOur executives’ compensation is very simple and generally has two basic components:\\n• Base salaries designed to be significantly less than those paid to senior leadership at similarly situated companies; and\\n• Periodic grants of time-vested restricted stock units subject to long-term vesting requirements that assume a fixed\\nannual increase in the stock price, so that compensation is negatively impacted if our stock price is flat or declines.\\nWe also provide security services to certain executives, some of which are reportable as perquisites, although we view all\\nCompany-incurred security costs as reasonable and necessary and for the Company’s benefit.\\nOver the past several years, directors serving on the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee and our Lead\\nIndependent Director, with the support of our ESG Engagement and Investor Relations teams, have actively engaged with, and\\nwere responsive to, our shareholders regarding our executive compensation program. The Leadership Development and\\nCompensation Committee did not grant an equity award to Mr. Jassy in 2024 and has not granted him an award since 2021,\\nconsistent with the Committee’s previous statement that the restricted stock unit award granted to Mr. Jassy in 2021, in\\nconnection with his promotion to President and CEO of Amazon, was intended to represent most of his compensation in the\\ncoming years. Consistent with its past practice of granting periodic long-term restricted stock unit awards every other year,\\nthe Committee granted restricted stock unit awards that vest over six years to each of the executive officers named in the\\nSummary Compensation Table other than Messrs. Jassy and Bezos. Mr. Selipsky, who was an executive officer for part of\\nthe year, forfeited all of his unvested restricted stock units upon his separation from the Company effective June 2024.\\nWe focus on realizable compensation by assessing the potential annual value of equity awards vesting over the long term.\\nMr. Jassy’s 2024 realized compensation (salary plus “all other compensation” as reported in the Summary Compensation Table,\\nplus value of stock vested during the year) increased compared to 2023 due to our stock price performance, partially\\noffset by the decrease in the number of restricted stock units vesting during the year.\\nWe believe our approach to executive compensation and its focus on building long-term shareholder value resonates with\\nour shareholders. At our 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, 78% of the votes cast supported our advisory vote to approve\\nthe compensation of our named executive officers. We are pleased with the broad and increasing level of support for our\\ncompensation practices, from our shareholders as well as others. Through our extensive outreach on our executive\\ncompensation program, we believe that even more shareholders have come to appreciate the view expressed by the\\nCouncil of Institutional Investors, Norges Bank Investment Management, and a number of our other largest investors, that\\ncompensating executives primarily through short-term, performance-conditioned equity awards is not a panacea, or even a\\npreferred approach, for aligning executive pay with performance, and that equity awards with long vesting terms can\\nmore effectively motivate and reward executives at a company like Amazon. This is borne out by ISS’s recent policy survey,\\nin which a majority of responding investors did not support ISS’s current policy that favors performance-conditioned equity\\nawards.

In that letter, he identified our compensation program as one of our\\nfundamental management approaches that, because of our emphasis on the long term, enables us to make decisions and\\nweigh tradeoffs differently than other companies.

We believe this focus on the long term has produced\\nstrong results for our shareholders over the past several decades.\\nAs with everything we do at Amazon, we have over the years reviewed and re-evaluated our executive compensation\\nprogram, taking into account the views of our shareholders, and we continue to do so. This includes evaluating arrangements\\nlike annual bonuses and one-, two-, or three-year performance-vesting equity awards. Having considered other approaches,\\nwe continue to believe the structure of our executive compensation—emphasizing periodic grants of time-vested restricted\\nstock units vesting over the long term—is best for our business, for three key reasons:\\n• It focuses on the true long-term success of our business, not on isolated one-, two-, or three-year goals that can encompass\\nonly a limited and selective portion of our objectives and that can reward executives with above-target payouts even\\nwhen the stock price remains flat or declines;\\n• It strongly and directly aligns our executives’ compensation with the returns we deliver to shareholders; and\\n• It works, having allowed us to:\\n✓ attract and retain incredibly talented people who have guided our business through countless challenges;\\n✓ develop our business in ways that we could not have conceived a few years earlier, including initiatives that later\\nbecame AWS, Kindle, Alexa, Fulfillment by Amazon, Marketplace, and Prime Video;\\n✓ make long-term commitments to sustainability and other environmental, social, and human capital initiatives and\\ngoals; and\\n✓ drive strong long-term returns to our shareholders.\\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\\n2025 Proxy Statement 63'),\n",

But we believe, and through our shareholder engagement many of our investors have acknowledged,\\nthat our equity awards vesting over five or six years or longer help drive long-term performance and therefore align pay with\\nperformance and shareholder value more effectively than cash or equity programs that tie target and above-target\\npayouts to discrete short-term results. Because our approach focuses on realizable compensation vesting over the long\\nterm, there are a number of important distinctions that shareholders should consider when assessing the amounts reported\\nin the Summary Compensation Table and when comparing those amounts with amounts reported by other companies:\\n• Amazon does not have an annual cash incentive program;\\n• Amazon’s practice has been to grant periodic (not annual) equity awards, as opposed to the annual grants made at other\\ncompanies;\\n• Amazon’s equity awards vest over five or more years, in contrast to typical three- or four-year vesting at other companies,\\nand the vesting schedule of our periodic equity awards is not pro-rata over the life of the award, but is typically back-\\nend weighted; and\\n• Amazon’s equity awards do not allow for more shares to be issued than valued in the Summary Compensation Table (i.e.,\\nno “above-target” share vesting).\\nWe have carefully considered the productive discussions we have had with our shareholders, the increasing level of support\\nfor our compensation practices from our shareholders and others, and the alternative compensation structures used by\\nother companies, including reviewing realized compensation at other companies. From those processes, we have determined\\nthat, based on how we run our business and what we have achieved, there are more risks than potential benefits from\\nchanging an approach that has been so successful for our shareholders over the past several decades and that holders of a\\nmajority of our shares continue to support, simply to fit into a “one size fits all” approach that does not reflect the nature\\nof our business, that focuses on discrete near-term targets and criteria, and that runs counter to our culture.\\nOur Approach to Broad-Based Compensation\\nOur goal of providing competitive compensation arrangements to attract and retain the best talent applies throughout\\nthe Company. For employees at most levels across the Company, we prioritize stock-based compensation that vests\\nover many years. In the United States, we are a leader in providing our front-line employees across our customer\\nfulfillment and transportation network an average base wage of more than $22 per hour, more than triple the federal\\nminimum wage. In addition, our average total compensation for front-line employees, including the value of elected\\nbenefits, is more than $29 per hour. Benefits include health care, a 401(k) plan with a Company match, flexible work\\nhours, and up to 20 weeks of paid pregnancy/parental leave (six weeks for eligible supporting parents). We also provide\\naccess to our pre-paid education program, called Career Choice. We have created hundreds of thousands of jobs\\nsince 2020, increasing our total employees worldwide to more than 1.5 million.\\nOur Compensation Design\\nOur simple executive compensation program has a number of unique features that reflect our goals and philosophy:\\n• We do not tie cash or equity compensation to one or a few discrete performance goals.To have a culture that\\nrelentlessly pursues invention and is focused on building shareholder value, not just for the current year, but five, ten, or\\neven twenty years from now, we must encourage experimentation and long-term thinking. By definition, this means we do\\nnot know in advance exactly what will work. We do not select one or a few discrete goals that address one-, two-, or three-\\nyear performance horizons because we do not want employees to focus on short-term returns or isolated criteria at\\nthe expense of long-term growth, a broad perspective, and constant innovation and reinvention. Instead, to align our\\nexecutives with long-term value creation, we compensate them primarily with restricted stock unit awards that have long\\nvesting periods, generally five years or more. Instead of significantly restructuring the straight-forward and effective\\ncompensation program that we have had in place for decades simply to conform with the complex programs tied to\\ndiscrete, safe, and short-term performance vesting criteria that fit the models preferred by the major proxy advisory firms,\\nwhich could constrain innovation and deter our executives from taking longer-term risks (and that could result in above-\\ntarget payouts even when our stock price declines), we believe our consistent focus on performance across the enterprise\\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\\n64'),\n",

AWS, Kindle, Alexa, Fulfillment by Amazon,\\nMarketplace, Prime Video, and The Climate Pledge might not exist today if our horizons were constrained by discrete\\nshort-term performance goals.\\n• We focus on long-term shareholder value that is realized by stock price appreciation.When we set our executives’\\ntarget compensation for periodic grants, we do not focus on the accounting value of awards that will be reported in\\nour proxy statement (which does not take into account the awards’ long-term and back-end weighted vesting terms and\\nour historical practice of making grants every other year), but instead on the actual, multi-year vesting schedule and\\npotential realizable compensation attributable to all of an executive’s stock awards. In valuing potential realizable\\ncompensation, we assume a fixed annual increase in the stock price, meaning that our executives’ compensation will be\\nnegatively impacted if our stock price is flat or declines, and is favorably impacted if the stock performs beyond the initial\\nstock price assumption. The alignment between our executives’ compensation and our stock price performance encourages\\nexecutives to seek out, develop, and pursue initiatives that focus on serving our customers and other stakeholders, and to\\nreflect a long-term view for thinking about our operations holistically and contributing to initiatives across the Company.\\n• We provide long-term visibility into compensation opportunities.We believe that establishing long-term\\ncompensation visibility for our executive team is an important way to foster an owner’s mindset from day one, and is also\\nan important way to encourage bold, long-term decisions that will lead to innovation—decisions that may not be\\nrewarded, and may possibly even be punished, in traditional incentive programs. We understand that our long vesting\\nschedules, especially for our CEO, are unusual among public companies, but we believe this lends great strength to our\\nprogram and helps make it among the most shareholder-aligned. Our long-term approach to performance and\\ncompensation has helped to retain our talent even during periods of short-term stock price volatility.\\n• We do not provide severance or retirement benefits or accelerate vesting upon termination or retirement.All of\\nour named executive officers are employed on an at-will basis. We do not maintain supplemental executive retirement or\\nother nonqualified deferred compensation plans, cash severance programs, or change-in-control benefits for our\\nexecutive officers (except for the limited situation that restricted stock units would vest if not assumed by an acquiror\\nfollowing a change in control and limited vesting of restricted stock units held by all employees other than the CEO upon\\ndeath). If an executive terminates employment or retires, all unvested equity is forfeited. For example, when Adam\\nSelipsky separated from the Company effective June 2024, he forfeited all of his unvested restricted stock units.\\n• We do not maintain executive compensation plans other than our stock plan.We generally do not provide cash\\nbonuses other than in a new-hire context and do not have an annual incentive program. As a result, our executives’\\ncompensation is easy for us to present to shareholders and easy for shareholders to understand and assess. There is no\\nneed for shareholders to be concerned with the selection or rigor of performance goals or to parse through overly\\ncomplicated payout formulas and dense descriptions of complicated “total rewards” programs. Our executives’\\ncompensation is tied to our shareholder returns, period.\\nBecause of these features, our executive compensation is highly transparent and, as shown in the Pay Versus Performance\\npresentation on page 79, strongly aligned with shareholder value. Unlike executive compensation at other companies, where\\nvaguely stated performance conditions and above-target payouts result in opaque and unpredictable compensation\\nunrelated to stock price and shareholder value, shareholders can look at our executives’ restricted stock unit holdings and\\nknow exactly how many shares will be delivered when they vest and know that the value of those shares will align with our\\nstock price performance.\\nAlignment with Performance\\nWe share the view expressed by the Council of Institutional Investors, Norges Bank Investment Management, and others\\nthat tying stock and cash award payouts to a handful of discrete performance criteria is a major source of complexity and\\nconfusion in executive pay and results in executive compensation arrangements that lack transparency since they are more\\ndifficult to value and more vulnerable to obfuscation than time-vesting restricted stock units, and often do not align with\\nlong-term performance. A 2019 study by Marc Hodak that appeared in Columbia Business School’s Journal of Applied\\nCorporate Finance, entitled “Are Performance Shares Shareholder Friendly?” (vol 31:3 Summer 2019), found that over a ten-\\nyear period, CEOs who received a significant portion of their equity awards in the form of performance-vesting stock units were\\nawarded median grant values that were roughly 35%higher than those for CEOs who received only restricted stock or\\nstock options. The same study reported that over every three-year performance period occurring over the course of a ten-\\nyear period, companies granting performance-vesting stock awards had lower three-year total shareholder returns than their\\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\\n2025 Proxy Statement 65'),\n",

In a commentary published in 2024 on the Harvard Law School Forum on\\nCorporate Governance website, Norges Bank Investment Management stated that it found the same performance results\\namong the companies in its portfolio. The Hodak study also concluded that performance-vested stock awards introduce\\n“short-termism” in management behavior, even if vesting is based on multi-year performance criteria, because they focus\\nexecutives on the goals being rewarded in the current year.\\nMoreover, performance-vested equity awards are less transparent than the restricted stock units that Amazon grants. At\\ncompanies that grant performance-vested equity, shareholders are not able to assess the value of the awards at grant or how\\nmuch executives may realize when the awards vest, because shareholders cannot assess the difficulty of the performance\\ncriteria applicable to those awards. The performance criteria are often opaque, and compensation committees often have\\ndiscretion to set aside performance results and adjust results to provide for above-target vesting of awards. Had we set one-,\\ntwo-, or three-year performance goals in the past based on achieving strong financial performance or based on achieving\\ndiscrete operational objectives, we likely would have paid out far more in compensation (150%, 200%, or more) than\\nwe actually did. In contrast, our executive compensation program is simple and transparent. We do not leverage or increase\\nshare awards to provide “above-target” or windfall payouts based on whether one or a few discrete goals were met, and\\nthe only way in which our executives can earn “above-target” compensation is to enhance our long-term share value, which\\nbenefits all shareholders.\\nWe believe that focusing on performance-vested equity awards that are tied to a few discrete performance metrics is not\\nthe best way for a dynamic and growth-oriented company like Amazon to align executive pay with long-term performance\\nand shareholder value. And investors agree; among investors who responded to ISS’s 2024 policy survey, a majority\\nresponded in favor of an approach other than ISS simply continuing its historical approach of favoring the use of performance-\\nvested equity awards over time-vested equity awards at U.S. companies. ISS reported that investors raised various concerns,\\nincluding that performance-vested equity programs “are often complex and that non-rigorous performance goals often\\nresult in vesting of significantly more than the target value.” In our view, selecting a handful of discrete performance metrics\\nas a basis for vesting or paying out compensation is fraught with the risk of improperly influencing or constraining long-term\\nperformance and inhibiting innovation. For example, in 1997, had we adopted performance measures appropriate for a\\nbookseller, we may have inadvertently discouraged our employees from investing their time and energy in initiatives that\\nlater became AWS, Kindle, Alexa, Fulfillment by Amazon, Marketplace, and Prime Video. To remain a highly innovative and\\nnimble company that is able to respond rapidly to dynamic market conditions and dramatic change—such as was required\\nduring the Covid-19 pandemic and in response to the recent surge in demand for AI-supported services—Amazon needs\\nto be able to shift course rapidly without executives being preoccupied with near-term performance criteria that might run\\ncounter to business needs.\\nTying compensation to specific business performance measures also could discourage employee mobility across our\\nbusinesses and, in particular, deter high-performing employees from taking important and challenging roles in businesses\\nthat could benefit most from their leadership. In addition, given the unique nature of Amazon, the diversity of our operations\\nand initiatives, and the dynamic and evolving nature of our business, standardized industry indices are either too broad—\\ntaking into account industries that are not reflected in the Company’s operations—or too narrow to serve as relevant\\ncomparisons for benchmarking company performance, as reflected in the Leadership Development and Compensation\\nCommittee’s experience in selecting peer companies for target compensation comparisons, as discussed below under\\n“Compensation Governance; Compensation Committee Process.” For example, benchmarking performance against a\\ntechnology index might have proven a disincentive to building our own devices, developing our own movies and TV shows,\\nor innovating shipping and delivery methods. A customized index locks in a business profile at a point in time, which may\\ndeter employees from developing and pursuing initiatives that do not fit into that mold, or would require adjustment over\\ntime given the five year or greater time horizons over which our executives’ equity awards vest, which could create the\\nappearance of gamesmanship or moving targets. Our compensation program allows and encourages us to innovate.\\nWe believe our executive compensation program works well for our employees and for our shareholders. For example, as of\\nthe end of 2024, our stock price had increased approximately 9,807% over twenty years (a compound annual growth rate\\nof 26%), 1,314% over ten years, and 137% over five years. This does not mean that our stock price increased on a year-over-\\nyear basis each of these years; for example, in 2014, our stock declined by 22%, and in 2022 our stock declined by 50%.\\nAs shown on the Pay Versus Performance presentation on page 79, the Compensation Actually Paid to our executives is directly\\nimpacted by our stock price performance.\\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\\n66'),\n",

Due to Mr. Bezos’s substantial ownership in\\nAmazon, Mr. Bezos requested not to receive additional compensation and has never received annual cash compensation in\\nexcess of his current amount.\\nAnnual Bonuses\\nNone of the named executive officers received an annual incentive or cash bonus in 2024.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nAs discussed above, the primary component of a named executive officer’s total compensation is stock-based compensation\\nin order to closely tie total compensation to long-term shareholder value. Accordingly, named executive officers receive\\nsizeable stock-based awards at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock-based awards in connection with promotions\\nand on a periodic basis.\\nSince late 2002, we have used restricted stock units as our primary stock-based compensation vehicle and have granted\\nperiodic awards to our executive officers on an every-other-year basis. We believe that restricted stock units align the long-term\\ninterests of named executive officers and shareholders and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock\\nawards. These restricted stock unit awards generally vest over a period of five years or more. Vesting does not accelerate as a\\nresult of termination of employment or retirement.\\nBecause our compensation program is designed to reward long-term performance and operate over many years, named\\nexecutive officers typically do not receive periodic stock-based awards every year. When we set our executives’ target\\ncompensation for these periodic grants, we assume a fixed annual increase in the stock price so that our executives’\\ncompensation will be negatively impacted if our stock price is flat or declines. Annual total compensation as reported in the\\nSummary Compensation Table below includes the entire fair value as of the grant date of a stock award granted in that\\nyear, without regard to the fact that the grant vests over a number of years and without regard to the fact that our past\\npractice has been to make periodic grants every other year and not annually. Unlike equity awards at some companies, the\\nstock awards reported below cannot payout for an “above-target” number of shares. As a result of these features, a named\\nexecutive officer’s total compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table will be higher in years in which he\\nor she receives a grant compared to years in which he or she does not receive a grant, and may not be comparable to amounts\\nreported by other companies. In contrast, as discussed above, when approving new equity awards, the Leadership\\nDevelopment and Compensation Committee does not focus on the aggregate grant date fair value that is required to be\\nreported in the Summary Compensation Table under SEC rules, but instead evaluates the annual value of the awards that will\\nvest in future years under various stock price scenarios, taking into account the named executive officer’s cash compensation\\nand the projected annual value of pre-existing stock-based compensation vesting in those subsequent years, if any.\\nDue to Mr. Bezos’s substantial stock ownership, he believes he is appropriately incentivized and his interests are appropriately\\naligned with shareholders’ interests. Accordingly, Mr. Bezos has never received any stock-based compensation from\\nAmazon.\\nConsiderations for 2024 Equity Grants\\nThe Leadership Development and Compensation Committee did not grant a restricted stock unit award for Mr. Jassy in\\n2024 and has not granted him an award since 2021. The Committee granted routine, periodic restricted stock unit awards\\nto Messrs. Olsavsky, Garman, Herrington, Zapolsky, and Selipsky, consistent with the Leadership Development and\\nCompensation Committee’s past practice of granting such awards every other year. Each of these restricted stock unit\\nawards vests over six years, assuming continued employment. In establishing these grants, the Committee reviewed realizable\\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\\n68'),\n",

In addition, in light of our Company’s and our executives’ prominence,\\nwe provide security for certain of our named executives, including security in addition to that provided at business facilities\\nand during business-related travel. We believe that all Company-incurred security costs are reasonable and necessary and\\nfor the Company’s benefit.

Amazon’s policy is that it does not provide other perquisites to our named\\nexecutive officers.\\nCompensation Governance\\nCompensation Committee Process\\nThe Leadership Development and Compensation Committee may engage compensation consultants but did not do so in\\n2024. In evaluating the compensation of our named executive officers in 2024, the Committee reviewed and discussed peer\\ncompany compensation benchmarking information from third-party surveys, including compensation data for retail,\\nInternet, technology, and media companies such as Alphabet, Apple, Cisco, Costco, Disney, Intel, Kroger, Meta, Microsoft,\\nNetflix, Oracle, Salesforce, Target, UPS, and Walmart.\\nRestricted stock unit grant amounts and vesting for named executive officers are established by the Leadership Development\\nand Compensation Committee after receiving recommendations from the Senior Vice President, People eXperience and\\nTechnology, and the CEO. Generally, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee considers whether to make\\nperiodic grants to executive officers in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process, which\\nnormally occurs between January and April. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee exercises discretion\\nin determining executive officers’ compensation and does not require that compensation be set at a specific level relative\\nto what is reflected in survey data that it reviews.\\nFor new hire, promotion, and periodic restricted stock unit awards, the Senior Vice President, People eXperience and\\nTechnology, and the CEO develop grant recommendations to set a total compensation target for each named executive\\nofficer by evaluating a variety of factors, such as the compensation of similarly situated senior executives at Amazon and at\\nother companies with which we compete for talent, past contributions to performance, and expected contributions to our\\nfuture success, and then designing restricted stock unit awards to help meet those total compensation targets. As discussed\\nabove, this evaluation also takes into account the named executive officer’s cash compensation and the estimated value\\nof pre-existing stock-based compensation vesting in subsequent years, if any, and stock price appreciation assumptions.\\nClawback Policy\\nWe have a compensation clawback policy that permits us to recover equity and cash bonuses from current and former\\nnamed executive officers and other members of senior management if they engage in fraud or intentional misconduct that\\ncauses or contributes to a restatement of our financial statements. In addition, the policy provides for recovery of any\\nincentive-based compensation, as defined under SEC and Nasdaq rules, in the event we are required to prepare an accounting\\nrestatement due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the federal\\nsecurities laws.\\nAnti-Hedging Policy\\nUnder our trading policies, directors, executive officers, and other employees above a specified level, as well as persons\\nsharing their households, are prohibited from engaging in any speculative, hedging, or derivative security transaction that\\nprimarily involves or references Amazon securities.

Accordingly, we do not tie cash or equity compensation to one or a few discrete\\nperformance goals, and instead we focus on long-term shareholder value that is realized by share price appreciation. When\\nwe set our executives’ target compensation for periodic restricted stock unit grants, we assume a fixed annual increase in\\nthe stock price so that our executives’ compensation is negatively impacted if our stock price is flat, declines, or otherwise\\nperforms below the initial stock price assumption, and is favorably impacted if the stock performs beyond the initial stock price\\nassumption. Because of these features, our executive compensation is highly transparent and strongly aligned with\\nshareholder value, as shown in the tables below.\\nRelationship between Compensation Actually Paid and Amazon’s TSR\\nThe restricted stock unit awards granted to our named executive officers generally carry long-term vesting schedules, as\\ndescribed above in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. As a result, our share price performance as reflected in our\\nTSR directly and significantly affects Compensation Actually Paid. Thus, as shown in the graphic below, in 2024 when our share\\nprice TSR was up approximately 45% for the year, our CEO’s Compensation Actually Paid was approximately $92.4 million,\\nreflecting the fact that the value of restricted stock units that vested during the year increased by approximately $6.4 million\\nfrom those awards’ value at the end of the prior year, and that the value of his unvested restricted stock units increased by\\napproximately $84.4 million. In contrast, in 2022 when our TSR declined approximately 50%, our CEO’s Compensation\\nActually Paid wasnegative $148 million, reflecting the fact that the value of restricted stock units that vested during the\\nyear declined by approximately $9.5 million from those awards’ value at the end of the prior year, and that the value of his\\nunvested restricted stock unitsdeclined by more than $139 million. In 2021, Mr. Jassy was granted a unique restricted stock\\nunit award in connection with his promotion to CEO, and more than 80% of the shares subject to that award are scheduled\\nto vest in 2026 through 2031 (years 5 through 10). Thus, the amount actually realized under Mr. Jassy’s 2021 restricted stock\\nunit award, which accounts for substantially all of his 2021 Compensation Actually Paid, was not actually earned by, or\\npaid to, Mr. Jassy in 2021 and instead will depend on and align directly with our future stock price performance over the\\nterm of the award. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee did not grant Mr. Jassy any equity awards\\nduring 2022, 2023, or 2024. The Compensation Actually Paid to Mr. Bezos, who served as our CEO in 2020 and the first half\\nof 2021, consisted of a fixed salary and the value of security arrangements provided for Mr. Bezos. Due to Mr. Bezos’s\\nsubstantial stock ownership, he believes he is appropriately incentivized and his interests are appropriately aligned with\\nshareholders’ interests. Accordingly, Mr. Bezos has never received any stock-based compensation or any cash compensation\\nfrom Amazon other than his salary.\\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\\n80'),\n",

For example, our net income increased to $59.2 billion for 2024 compared to $30.4 billion for\\n2023.

In addition, our average total compensation\\nfor front-line employees, including the value of elected benefits, is more than $29 per hour. Benefits include health care,\\na 401(k) plan with a Company match, flexible work hours, and up to 20 weeks of paid pregnancy/parental leave (six weeks\\nfor eligible supporting parents). We are also empowering our employees to build the skills they need to remain competitive,\\ngrow their careers, and move into higher-paying roles. In 2023, we achieved our goal to invest $1.2 billion to provide\\nprepaid education and technical skills training to over 300,000 of our U.S. employees by 2025—with over 350,000 U.S.\\nemployees participating in our upskilling programs. For purposes of identifying the median compensated employee, we took\\ninto account salary, bonus, and grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the year for all our employees\\nas of October 1, 2024. We also annualized compensation for employees who did not work the entire year, except for\\nemployees designated as seasonal or temporary.\\nCertain Relationships and Related Person\\nTransactions\\nJeff Bezos, our founder and Executive Chair, owns Blue Origin, an aerospace manufacturer and spaceflight services company,\\nand entities that publish The Washington Post, and we do business in the ordinary course with each company. In 2024,\\nAmazon sold approximately $12.3 million of consumer goods to Blue Origin under a line of credit. In 2024, Amazon purchased\\napproximately $770,000 of advertising from, and paid approximately $2.5 million related to digital content to, the\\nWashington Post entities, all on terms negotiated on an arms-length basis.\\nAs previously disclosed, in 2022, Amazon announced agreements with Blue Origin and a third party pursuant to which it\\nexpects to pay approximately $7.4 billion for satellite launch and related services through 2028, of which approximately\\n$2.7 billion was expected to be paid to Blue Origin. The actual amounts paid to Blue Origin and the third party may be higher\\nor lower based on various factors. Since the beginning of the last fiscal year, Amazon paid approximately $1.7 billion\\nunder the agreements, and approximately $578 million is estimated to have been paid to Blue Origin.\\nConnor Clinton, an employee of Amazon, is the son-in-law of Brian Olsavsky, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial\\nOfficer of the Company. In 2024, Mr. Clinton earned $157,100 in salary. He was also granted a restricted stock unit award\\nwith respect to 535 shares, vesting over 2.9 years. His compensation is consistent with the total compensation provided to\\nother employees of the same level with similar responsibilities.\\nWe may, from time to time, participate in additional arms’ length transactions with entities affiliated with our Related\\nPersons in the ordinary course of business. The Audit Committee reviews and, as appropriate, approves and ratifies “related\\nperson” transactions, defined as any transaction, arrangement, or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee\\nof indebtedness), or any series of similar transactions, arrangements, or relationships, in which (a) the aggregate amount\\ninvolved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000, (b) Amazon is a participant, and (c) any Related Person has or will have\\na direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or trustee (or any similar position) or a\\nless than 10 percent beneficial owner of another entity). A “Related Person” is any (a) person who is an executive officer,\\ndirector, or nominee for election as a director of Amazon, (b) greater than 5 percent beneficial owner of our outstanding\\ncommon stock, or (c) Immediate Family Member of any of the foregoing.
