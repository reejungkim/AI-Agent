      "Analysis\n",
      "Given these issues with the Green Pill, the client would like your help in determining specifically how to maintain as much revenue \n",
      "as possible from the Purple Pill when it goes off patent next year.  It has several options that it would like for you to evaluate.\n",
      "Options:\n",
      "1. Do nothing\n",
      "2. License the brand to an over the counter (OTC) manufacturer for $250M one-time revenue\n",
      "3. Direct-to-patient campaign online and pay 3rd party for delivery\n",
      "Additional facts and assumptions:\n",
      "• With no action, Green Pill lost 20% of annual volume in the past (use this assumption)\n",
      "• Current revenue per pill is $1 at an 80% margin – (remember, total revenue $3.2B)\n",
      "• 10% of current Purple Pill volume will transfer to OTC brand – we get only one time revenue\n",
      "• Direct to patient will retain 25% that would’ve been lost to generic but the margin would be reduced to 50% \n",
      "• Over 2/3 of the Purple Pill’s revenue comes from the US.\n",
      "Recommendation\n",
      "Ask:  What would you do and why?  What are your assumptions on incremental or retained volume in each scenario? Why?\n",
      "The head of Purple Pill brand needs to make a decision would like for us to share our recommendation today.  Please share your \n",
      "analysis and recommendation.\n",

      "Analysis\n",
      "Decision\n",
      "Math: \n",
      "• Do nothing: $3.2B x .80 retained (20% lost) = $2.5B revenue x 80% margin = $2B gross profit\n",
      "• License for $250M  = $2B + $250M = $2.25B – (10% x $3.2B x 80%) = $2.25B - $0.256B = -$60K\n",
      "• Direct to patient program - Do nothing = $2B + (20% lost  x 25% of this retained x $3.2B x 50% margin) = $2B + $.08B = $2.08B\n",
      "Guidance:\n",
      "The math is important here, but more important is that the candidate can think through short-term and long term scenarios. For \n",
      "example, licensing may look like breakeven in year one and retain the brand, but it is a long-term loss as there is no additional revenue \n",
      "(the $250B) in year 2. You would want there to be little to no cannibalization.\n",
      "Also, if the direct to patient program cannibalizes more of your existing 80% margin business, you will lose money if you don’t increase \n",
      "the price. \n",
      "This case gauges the candidates comfort with making assumptions and making strategic decisions.\n",
